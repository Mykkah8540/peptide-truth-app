# Pep-Talk Stacks – Governance (v1)

## Purpose

Stacks exist to help users **explore synergistic combinations of peptides** in a way that:

- Maximizes cumulative benefit
- Minimizes cumulative risk
- Preserves educational integrity
- Surfaces governed tribal knowledge

Stacks are **not protocols**.  
Stacks are **not instructions**.  
Stacks are **systems-level educational groupings**.

---

## Definition: What a Stack Is

A **stack** is a curated or user-created combination of peptides and/or blends that:

- Share complementary mechanisms
- Support a common goal
- Avoid known conflicts or redundant risk
- Emphasize synergy over quantity

A canonical example is **KLOW** — a combination so widely recognized for synergy that manufacturers packaged it as a single blend.  
KLOW represents the *ideal stack archetype*.

Stacks may be:
- Curated by Pep-Talk
- Generated via the Stack Builder
- Suggested by the community (UGC, moderated)

There is **no hard limit** on what may be included in a stack. Governance replaces restriction.

---

## Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)

### 1. Synergy First

Stacks must be presented as **systems**, not collections.

The primary narrative is:
> “How these compounds work together.”

Stacks must not devolve into:
- Individual peptide monographs
- PDP duplication
- Evidence dumps
- Long-form documents

---

### 2. Compounding Benefit Without Compounding Risk

The system must actively surface:
- Mechanism overlap
- Interaction class conflicts
- Redundant risk patterns (e.g., dual GLP-1s)

Warnings must be:
- Clear
- Calm
- Educational
- Non-alarmist

No silent failures.  
No fear framing.

---

### 3. Exploration Over Instruction

Stacks are an **exploration surface**, not a guide.

Therefore, stacks must never include:
- Dosing
- Schedules
- Protocols
- Timelines
- “Start with / increase to” language

Language must remain **descriptive**, never prescriptive.

---

### 4. Clean, Minimal, High-Signal UX

Stacks must feel:
- Calm
- Modern
- Intentional
- Non-congested

This is not a document dump.

Detail exists **behind interaction**, not in the default view.

---

## Stack Page UX Contract

### Required Sections (In Order)

#### 1. Stack Identity
- Stack name
- Goal tags
- One-line purpose
- Short synergy description (4–8 lines max)

This section answers:
> “Why does this combination exist?”

---

#### 2. Synergy Summary (System View)

A compact explanation of:
- Foundation effects
- Support effects
- Protective or mitigating roles
- Complementary (not duplicate) mechanisms

No more than:
- One short paragraph **or**
- Five concise bullets

---

#### 3. Compounds (Interactive, Minimal)

Each compound must:
- Be individually clickable → PDP
- Have a single role label
- Optionally expand to 1–2 sentences

Compounds may be grouped:
- Core
- Support
- Optional

No long descriptions by default.

---

#### 4. Compatibility & Risk Signals

Stacks must surface:
- Mechanism overlap
- Interaction conflicts
- Category redundancy

Signals are presented as:
- Green: no known issue
- Yellow: overlap / caution
- Red: conflict

Each signal includes:
- Short explanation
- Optional expansion

---

#### 5. “Goes Well With” Suggestions

Optional exploratory suggestions based on:
- Goal alignment
- Missing support roles
- Common synergistic pairings

Each suggestion must include:
- Why it fits (one sentence)
- No implied instruction

---

#### 6. Community Notes (UGC)

Stacks support moderated community notes:
- Short experiential observations
- No prescriptive directives
- No personalized instruction
- No timelines

Same governance rules as peptide and blend notes.

---

## Stack Builder Governance

### Purpose

The Stack Builder exists to:
- Help users assemble goal-aligned combinations
- Surface compatibility checks in real time
- Encourage thoughtful construction, not maximal inclusion

---

### Builder Flow (Required)

1. Goal selection
2. Suggested starter stack
3. User adds/removes compounds
4. Live compatibility feedback updates
5. Stack may be saved (Pro)

---

### Builder Constraints

- Users may combine anything
- The system must always surface warnings
- The system must never hard-block creation
- Education > restriction

---

## Stacks & Accounts

- Saved stacks live under **My Peps** (Pro)
- Users may:
  - Save
  - Duplicate
  - Modify
  - Archive

Sharing is future-scoped and not assumed.

---

## UGC Stack Submissions

Users may suggest stacks for review:
- Same no-dosing acknowledgment
- Same moderation workflow
- Reviewed before publication

Pep-Talk may feature:
- Top community stacks
- Curated Pep-Talk stacks
- Goal-based featured stacks

---

## Explicit Non-Goals

Stacks will **never**:
- Replace PDPs
- Use prescriptive directive language (e.g., “you should,” “start at,” “take X”)
- Provide personalized instruction
- Serve as medical advice
- Optimize for SEO keyword stuffing

Stacks **may** include observational transparency when it increases clarity and reduces harm:
- Clinical ranges / schedules as studied (when relevant)
- Common real-world patterns users report (titration, duration, discontinuation)
- Common stacking patterns and tradeoffs

All observational content must be:
- Descriptive, not directive
- Lane-separated (Clinical Evidence vs Observed Patterns)
- Non-personalized

---

## Enforcement

If a stack:
- Becomes verbose
- Duplicates PDP content
- Introduces instruction
- Adds fear framing

It is **out of compliance** and must be revised.

---

## Summary

Stacks are the **highest-order abstraction** in Pep-Talk.

They are:
- Where tribal knowledge lives
- Where synergy is explored
- Where safety is contextualized
- Where Pro value is justified

Stacks must feel **world-class, calm, and intelligent**.
