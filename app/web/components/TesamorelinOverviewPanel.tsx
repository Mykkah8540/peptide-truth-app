        Tesamorelin (Egrifta) is the only FDA-approved growth hormone-releasing compound currently on the US market. It works the same way as CJC-1295 and sermorelin — prompting your pituitary to release more growth hormone — but it has something those compounds lack: controlled clinical trial evidence for reducing deep abdominal fat. That&rsquo;s the honest case for it. The honest caveat is that the trials were in HIV patients with lipodystrophy, not healthy adults chasing body recomposition.

        <blockquote className="reta-overview__profile-think">&ldquo;I have this stubborn belly fat that doesn&rsquo;t respond to diet and exercise. Someone told me tesamorelin specifically targets visceral fat. Is that real?&rdquo;</blockquote>
        <p className="reta-overview__profile-why-heading">Why they&rsquo;re excited</p>
        <ol className="reta-overview__profile-why">
          <li><strong>The visceral fat claim has actual trial data behind it</strong><br />Unlike most peptides where fat loss is speculated from animal studies, tesamorelin has Phase III randomized controlled trial evidence for reducing visceral fat — the deep fat around your organs. That makes the claim more credible than anything in the gray-market GHRH space.</li>
          <li><strong>It&rsquo;s FDA-approved, which means a prescription pathway exists</strong><br />If a physician determines it&rsquo;s appropriate, you can get this through a legitimate pharmacy, with proper dosing and monitoring — not from an unregulated peptide supplier. That&rsquo;s a meaningful difference in access and safety context.</li>
        </ol>
        <p className="reta-overview__profile-check-heading">Reality check</p>
        <p className="reta-overview__profile-check">The trials were in HIV patients who developed lipodystrophy — a specific fat redistribution syndrome caused by certain antiretroviral drugs. Visceral fat responded significantly in that population. Whether healthy adults without that condition get the same results is extrapolated from the mechanism, not proven in controlled conditions. It also requires a prescription from a physician willing to prescribe off-label, can elevate blood sugar in people with insulin resistance, and costs significantly more than other GHRH compounds. Net: the fat data is real, but the population it was proven in isn&rsquo;t most people asking about it.</p>

        <h3 className="reta-overview__profile-heading">The Athlete &mdash; Body Recomposition Without Exogenous Growth Hormone</h3>
        <blockquote className="reta-overview__profile-think">&ldquo;I want to lean out without touching actual growth hormone or anything that will tank my natural production. Is tesamorelin a smarter option?&rdquo;</blockquote>
        <p className="reta-overview__profile-why-heading">Why they&rsquo;re excited</p>
        <ol className="reta-overview__profile-why">
          <li><strong>It preserves pulsatile growth hormone release</strong><br />Exogenous growth hormone suppresses your body&rsquo;s own production and blunts the normal pulsatile rhythm. GHRH analogs like tesamorelin work upstream — prompting the pituitary to release growth hormone in a more natural pattern. For athletes concerned about long-term axis health, that distinction matters.</li>
          <li><strong>The visceral fat evidence applies to body composition goals</strong><br />Even if the trial population was specific, the mechanism — growth hormone driving lipolysis in visceral fat stores — is plausible across populations. For someone who runs a caloric deficit with good protein intake, the additive visceral fat effect of elevated growth hormone is a reasonable expectation.</li>
        </ol>
        <p className="reta-overview__profile-check-heading">Reality check</p>
        <p className="reta-overview__profile-check">Tesamorelin has a more prominent arthralgia and myalgia (joint and muscle pain) profile in its clinical trial data than CJC-1295 does in community use — that&rsquo;s documented in the prescribing information and worth knowing before adding this to a training stack. Joint pain that interferes with training is a real cost. It also elevates blood sugar, which matters more if your training diet is carbohydrate-heavy. Net: mechanistically sound for recomp goals, but the joint pain signal is the meaningful trade-off versus its GHRH cousins.</p>

        <blockquote className="reta-overview__profile-think">&ldquo;Most GHRH peptides have no human RCT data. Tesamorelin actually does. How much of that translates to what I care about — metabolic health, body composition, and growth hormone optimization?&rdquo;</blockquote>

        <ol className="reta-overview__profile-why">
          <li><strong>The only GHRH analog with controlled human outcome data</strong><br />CJC-1295 has one published trial confirming it elevates growth hormone and IGF-1. Tesamorelin has Phase III data specifically measuring a clinically meaningful outcome (visceral fat mass). For someone who needs more than &ldquo;it raises IGF-1&rdquo; to justify a compound, tesamorelin is the most evidence-supported GHRH option available.</li>
          <li><strong>Prescription access means compounding pharmacy quality control</strong><br />Gray-market GHRH peptides have no quality standards. Tesamorelin, accessed through a physician, comes through regulated pharmaceutical channels with consistent dosing and purity verification. For someone who values that, it&rsquo;s a meaningful practical difference.</li>
        </ol>
        <p className="reta-overview__profile-check-heading">Reality check</p>
        <p className="reta-overview__profile-check">The lipodystrophy trial population had a specific metabolic abnormality driving their visceral fat accumulation — one that may respond differently to growth hormone axis manipulation than normal metabolic variation. The human evidence is the best in its class, but &ldquo;best in class&rdquo; for GHRH analogs still means limited. The arthralgia signal documented in the prescribing information is real and not fully explained by the GH/fluid retention effect alone. And like all GHRH analogs, cancer history is a hard stop — the IGF-1 elevation from any GHRH compound is mitogenic in contexts with existing neoplastic processes. Net: the most data-supported GHRH choice, but the evidence base for off-label optimization use is still extrapolated, not direct.</p>
