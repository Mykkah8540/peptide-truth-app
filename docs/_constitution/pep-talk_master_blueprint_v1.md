# Pep-Talk Master Blueprint v1
Full System Architecture, Content Model, Modeling Logic, and Governance Doctrine

This document describes Pep-Talk in full maturity.

It is written so that a new engineer, editor, or future operator could build or maintain Pep-Talk without meeting the founder.

Nothing is assumed.
Nothing is implied.
Everything is explicit.

---

# PART 1: Core Product Identity

Pep-Talk is a peptide intelligence and modeling ecosystem.

It combines:

- Comprehensive peptide library (92+ peptides and expanding)
- Evidence tier classification system
- Dual-lane truth model
- Goal-based orientation (Wellness Paths)
- Stack modeling engine (Pro)
- Personal workspace (My Peps)
- Moderated Community Stacks library (Pro)
- Ongoing intelligence updates

Pep-Talk is not a prescriber.

It is not a clinic.

It is not a supplement funnel.

It is a structured clarity and modeling platform.

# PART 2: The Three Entry Doors

The homepage must present three equally strong doors:

1. Explore by Peptide
2. Start with Your Goal
3. Build a Stack

Each must include:
- One sentence explaining who it’s for
- One sentence explaining what it delivers
- No hype language
- No fear language

Navigation must always preserve these three paths.

---

# PART 3: Peptide Library Specification

The library contains 92+ peptides with uneven evidence quality.

This is expected.

Pep-Talk solves uneven depth by:

- Consistent PDP structure
- Evidence tier transparency
- Explicit uncertainty framing
- Observed pattern inclusion
- No filler content

New peptides must be addable without architectural refactor.

Minimum metadata per peptide:

- slug
- display_name
- category
- evidence_tier (A/B/C)
- mechanism_tags
- receptor_tags
- system_tags
- appetite_modulation_score
- hormonal_axis_tags
- risk_score
- experimental_density_weight
- side_effect_clusters
- outcome_tags
- clinical_summary
- observed_patterns_summary
- dosing_studies_summary
- observed_protocol_patterns
- risk_notes
- known_unknowns
- bottom_line

This structured spine powers:

- Search
- Filters
- Wellness Paths
- Stack Builder overlap logic
- Risk alerts
- Tier mix outputs

---

# PART 4: Evidence Tier System

Tier A – Clinically Mature  
Tier B – Emerging  
Tier C – Experimental  

Each tier must have documented assignment logic.

Tier must appear visually near the top of every PDP.

Tier must influence:
- Stack experimental density
- Risk concentration alerts
- Path labeling

---

# PART 5: PDP Full Structural Template

Every PDP must include these sections in order:

1. Why People Look This Up
Reflect real search intent and real concerns.

2. What This Is
Plain language definition.

3. Real-World Use Context
Why people consider it.

4. Evidence Tier + What That Means
Short interpretation of tier.

5. What You Can Realistically Expect
Common outcomes and common disappointments.

6. Clinical Evidence (Lane 1)
Study-based findings and limitations.

7. Observed Patterns (Lane 2)
Common real-world patterns.
Common failure modes.
Common quit reasons.

8. Dosing & Use Patterns
A. Study dose ranges  
B. Observed titration patterns  
C. Practical tolerability notes  

Never written as instruction.

9. Risks & Tradeoffs
System impacts.
Stack amplification potential.
Muscle loss risks where relevant.
Hormonal considerations.

10. Mechanism
Plain explanation first.
Deep mechanism second.

11. Known Unknowns
Explicit list.

12. Bottom Line
Produce informed, empowered, steadied.

---

# PART 6: Wellness Paths

Paths translate:

Goal → Biological Levers → Peptide Landscape → Tradeoffs → Modeling

Each path must include:

- Real problem framing
- Biological systems in plain language
- Peptides by tier
- Observed combination patterns
- Common failure points
- Direct link to Stack Builder with preloaded filters

Paths must reduce overwhelm.

---

# PART 7: Stack Builder Specification

Stack Builder is Pro core.

Inputs:
- Peptides
- Goal
- Evidence tier filter
- Risk tolerance filter

Outputs:

1. Plain-language stack orientation summary
2. Evidence tier mix breakdown
3. Experimental density indicator
4. Mechanism overlap map
5. System impact overlap
6. Appetite stacking indicator
7. Hormonal axis overlap
8. Side effect amplification signals
9. Risk concentration alerts
10. Observed pattern references

Interpretation must feel human.

Not dashboard-only.

No instruction language allowed.

---

# PART 8: My Peps

Users can:

- Save peptides
- Save stacks
- Duplicate and iterate stacks
- Add notes
- Tag by goal
- Compare versions

Must feel calm and simple.

---

# PART 9: Community Stacks

Structured submissions only.

Required fields:

- Goal
- Duration
- Peptides included
- Outcome rating
- Side effects
- Surprise factors
- Why stopped
- Would repeat
- Experience level

Moderation required.

Aggregated outputs feed:

- PDP observed patterns
- Stack alerts
- Intelligence updates

No open comment chaos.

---

# PART 10: Updates & Intelligence

Pep-Talk must publish:

- Evidence changes
- Hype corrections
- Pattern shifts
- New peptide integrations

Tone remains calm and practical.

---

# PART 11: Monetization Model

Free includes:
- All PDPs
- Tier display
- Lane separation
- Basic paths

Pro includes:
- Stack Builder
- My Peps
- Community Stacks
- Advanced overlays
- Advanced comparisons
- Deeper breakdowns
- Updates archive

Users pay for modeling power and organization.

Not truth access.

---

# PART 12: Governance

Governance must enforce:

- Tone charter compliance
- Lane separation
- Practical transparency
- PDP template consistency
- Evidence tier requirement
- No hype drift

Governance must not:

- Strip practical content
- Remove observational transparency
- Over-legalize tone
- Flatten personality

---

# PART 13: Maturity Standard

Pep-Talk is mature when:

- Beginners feel oriented immediately.
- Advanced users can model deeply.
- Dosing transparency exists without prescription.
- Community adds signal, not chaos.
- The experience consistently produces informed, empowered, steadied.

Pep-Talk is:

Calm intelligence  
Structured data  
Practical reality  
Modeling power  
Human gravity  

This is the full system.
