          GI side effects are common and manageable for most people — they peak early and settle. Lean mass loss is real but preventable with protein and training. Pancreatitis is rare but warrants knowing the signal. Long-term effects are genuinely unknown — this is Phase 2 data.
        </p>
        <p>
          The biggest risk for most people isn&apos;t dramatic — it&apos;s quietly under-eating protein, under-hydrating, and losing muscle they didn&apos;t mean to lose. The mitigation is boring and it works.
