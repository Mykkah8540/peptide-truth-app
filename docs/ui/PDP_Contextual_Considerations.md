# PDP Contextual Considerations System
## “Things to Consider for Your Situation”

This document is authoritative. It defines a permanent PDP feature and the guardrails for its implementation across Pep Talk.

This file is not guidance.
It is law.


## Purpose

This system exists to address the reality that many visitors are already consuming, or considering consuming, peptides.
Pep Talk does not prescribe, discourage, or instruct. Pep Talk educates.

This section provides contextual understanding so users can make more informed decisions elsewhere.


## Section Title (LOCKED)

### Things to Consider for Your Situation

### Subline (LOCKED)
People respond differently to the same peptide. Age, health conditions, medications, and biology can all change how this compound is discussed and experienced.


## What This Section Is

- A contextual knowledge explorer
- Opt-in depth
- Consumer-facing
- Non-directive
- Regulation-proof

## What This Section Is Not

- Not medical advice
- Not eligibility checking
- Not recommendations
- Not approval or denial
- Not protocols, dosing, or timing


## UI Placement

- Appears on every Peptide PDP
- Positioned after core explanation sections
- Before community comments
- Used to balance PDP layout visually (right-side or secondary panel)


## Interaction Model

### Input
Single search field

Placeholder text (LOCKED):
Search by condition, medication, age, or situation

Optional helper text:
Explore how different contexts are discussed in relation to this peptide.


## Allowed Query Examples

- Thyroid conditions
- Autoimmune conditions
- Antidepressants (SSRIs)
- Hormonal conditions
- Older adults
- Women / men
- Metabolic conditions
- Pregnancy

Queries implying directives must be reframed internally.


## Response Structure (MANDATORY)

All responses must include the following sections:

### 1. Context Summary
Why this context matters biologically or mechanistically.

### 2. What Is Known
Mechanistic overlap, documented research discussions.

### 3. What Is Unclear or Limited
Explicit uncertainty is required.

### 4. Why Experiences Vary
Explain variability without moralizing.

### 5. Framing Line (LOCKED)
This information is meant to add context — not to decide what’s right for any individual.


## Hard Boundaries (ENFORCED)

This system must never:
- Give recommendations
- Use “you should” language
- Assign suitability
- Provide dosing, timing, or protocols
- Score risk
- Say safe / unsafe


## Governance Principle

Pep Talk content must remain accurate whether peptides are:
- Unregulated
- Regulated
- Restricted
- Prescription-only
- Removed entirely

If a sentence would not survive that future, it does not ship.


## Status

This system is:
- Approved
- Copy-locked
- Governance-defined
- Required for PDP rebuild

Any PDP implementation that does not conform to this document is out of alignment.
