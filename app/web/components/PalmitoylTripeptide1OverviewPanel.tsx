        Palmitoyl tripeptide-1 is a cosmetic signal peptide and the second active component
        of the Matrixyl 3000 combination (paired with palmitoyl pentapeptide-4). It signals
        fibroblasts to produce collagen I, III, and fibronectin via a collagen-derived
        fragment with a distinct receptor binding profile from its pentapeptide partner.
      </p>
      <div className="reta-overview__body">
        <p>
          The peptide sequence (Gly-His-Lys, or GHK) is derived from the N-terminal domain
          of collagen I and has been studied independently as a wound-healing and
          anti-inflammatory signal. The palmitoyl lipid tail is added to improve dermal
          penetration through the stratum corneum\u2014the same strategy used for palmitoyl
          pentapeptide-4.
        </p>
        <p>
          A critical distinction: palmitoyl tripeptide-1 is almost exclusively studied in
          combination with palmitoyl pentapeptide-4 as Matrixyl 3000. Isolating its
          independent contribution is difficult because nearly all formulation trials use
          the combination. Its standalone efficacy, dose-response, and optimal concentration
          range are not well characterized independently.
        </p>
        <p>
          The receptor binding profile differs from palmitoyl pentapeptide-4\u2019s KTTKS
          sequence: GHK has a longer history as a copper-chelating peptide (as in GHK-Cu)
          with broader published literature on wound healing, skin repair, and
          anti-inflammatory activity. The palmitoylated form trades some of that
          water-solubility for enhanced penetration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Industry-funded studies report synergistic benefit from the combination. Independent
          evidence for the combination as a whole is modest; evidence for palmitoyl
          tripeptide-1 in isolation is thinner still. As with its partner compound, the
          fundamental unanswered question is dermal bioavailability\u2014how much intact
          peptide reaches fibroblasts in living skin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tolerance profile is very similar to palmitoyl pentapeptide-4: extremely low
          toxicity for standard topical use, rare contact sensitization. No injectable use
          has been studied or has any rational basis.
