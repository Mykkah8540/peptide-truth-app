Phase 3 REDEFINE trials have demonstrated superior weight loss compared to semaglutide alone \u2014 this is the clinical rationale for the combination."

    "synergy_note": "GLP-1 and amylin receptor signaling produce satiety through distinct circuits that don't overlap. Combining them generates greater appetite suppression than either alone without requiring higher GLP-1 doses \u2014 which is significant because most of semaglutide's GI side effects are dose-dependent.
