# Pep-Talk PDP Content Contract (V1)

Status: LOCKED  
Applies to:
- Peptide PDPs
- Blend PDPs
- Stack Builder PDPs
- Any future entity PDPs

This contract defines what a Pep-Talk page is, how it speaks, and what it must deliver to users. No section may contradict this contract.

Core Principle (Non-Negotiable)

Pep-Talk explains peptides the way a smart, honest friend would — not a lawyer, not a marketer, not a scientist talking to other scientists.

If a normal person wouldn’t say it out loud in conversation, we don’t say it.

1 Header (Above the Fold)

Purpose: Immediate clarity + trust

Must Include
- Entity name
- Entity type (Peptide / Blend / Stack)
- One-line disclaimer:
  “Educational resource. Not medical advice. No dosing or instructions.”

Safety Indicator (Human-Readable Only)
- Generally safe
- Moderately safe
- Mixed / uncertain
- Known risk
- High risk

Optional

Tone Rules
- Conversational
- Clear
- Zero legal language
- Zero academic jargon
- Zero disclaimers

Explicit Rule (Locked)
Banned language (examples)
- “multi-pathway metabolic effects”
- “mechanistic signaling”
- “pathway modulation”
- anything a real person would never say

Required style
Say what it does in human terms.

Example (acceptable)
“People are interested because it may help increase metabolism and support fat loss beyond just reducing appetite.”

3 Current Outlook & Intended Use

Purpose: Deeper explanation without losing the human.

Includes

Allowed Language
- “Not approved for…”

- “Anecdotal reports often mention…”

Rules
- No dosing
- No instructions
- No promises
- No fear language

4 Why People Are Interested

Purpose: Capture real motivations — honestly.

Format
- Bullet points

5 Identity (Bottle-Label Information)

Purpose: Clean technical reference, nothing more.

Show
- Name
- Type (peptide / blend / stack)
- Also known as (aliases)

Hide
- slug
- canonical_name
- internal identifiers

No safety, no evidence, no repetition.

6 Practical Summary (Contextual Disclaimer)

Purpose: Ground expectations without killing curiosity.

Includes
- Availability status (prescription / investigational / research)
- What this is commonly not
- Where caution applies

Tone
- Calm
- Neutral
- Trust-building

7 Interactions & Medication Considerations

Purpose: Surface real-world interaction risks.

Rules
- Section only appears if populated

8 Developmental / Adolescent Risk (Conditional)

Purpose: Serious, age-related risk disclosure.

Appears ONLY if

- Reviews
- Journals
- Clear explanation of evidence strength

Rules
- Evidence grades must be explained in human terms

10 Risk References

Purpose: Explain why risk exists, with receipts.

Links to:
- Hormonal axis risks
- Developmental concerns
- Metabolic risks
- Evidence limitations

11 Neutral Closing Summary

Purpose: Balanced final word.

Tone
- Honest
- Calm
- Unbiased

Example
“This peptide shows strong promise in metabolic research, but long-term human data remains limited. People should approach information cautiously and seek professional medical guidance.”

12 Global Footer Disclaimer (ALL PAGES)
