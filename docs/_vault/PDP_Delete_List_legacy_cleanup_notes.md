# PDP Delete List (Authoritative Removals)

This file is authoritative.
If PDP copy or UI patterns conflict with this list, the PDP must be rewritten.

## Remove Everywhere (UI copy + PDP body copy)
- “Not medical advice” sprayed mid-page
- “No protocols / no dosing / no instructions” sprayed mid-page
- Any “how to” phrasing that implies action
- Any “best / optimal / guaranteed” language
- Any suitability language:
  - “right for you”
  - “safe / unsafe”
  - “you should / you shouldn’t”
  - “recommended for”
- Any acquisition framing:
  - where to buy
  - source/vendor talk
  - purchasing CTAs

## Remove From Peptide PDPs Specifically
- Protocol-style section headers (anything that reads like steps)
- Timing/cycle/reconstitution language
- “Stack recommendations” inside peptide pages (stacks are separate surfaces)
- Fear-based disclaimers inside the reading flow

## Replace With (Allowed Patterns)
- Mechanism-first explanation
- Evidence framing:
  - what is known
  - what is unclear/limited
  - why experiences vary
- Regulation-proof framing (content must survive Rx-only or removed markets)
- Centralized disclaimer surface only (no repetition inside content)
