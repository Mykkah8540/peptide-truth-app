# Pep-Talk Human & Tone Charter v1
Full Identity, Voice, and Human Integration Doctrine

This document exists to prevent Pep-Talk from drifting.

Drift can happen slowly. It can happen subtly. It can happen through well-meaning edits, compliance anxiety, technical refactoring, or tone over-correction.

This charter protects against three primary failure states:

1. Sterile Encyclopedia Drift  
2. Compliance-Only Drift  
3. Emotionally Flat Drift  

Pep-Talk must never become any of those.

This document defines what Pep-Talk feels like, sounds like, and protects.

If content contradicts this document, this document wins.

## SECTION 1: The Human Outcome Standard

Every page, tool, and feature must produce three outcomes in the user:

Informed  
Empowered  
Steadied  

If one of those is missing, the experience is incomplete.

### Informed

The user understands:

- What the peptide or concept actually is
- What is clinically known
- What is uncertain
- What outcomes are realistic
- What tradeoffs are common
- What is frequently misunderstood

Not abstractly.
Not vaguely.
Not academically.

Clearly.

The user should be able to explain it to someone else after reading.

### Empowered

The user feels capable of:

- Evaluating tradeoffs
- Comparing options
- Modeling combinations
- Identifying risk stacking
- Recognizing hype
- Making a decision without panic

Empowerment is not giving instruction.

Empowerment is giving clarity.

### Steadied

This is the most important.

The user feels:

- Less anxious
- Less overwhelmed
- Less reactive
- Less alone
- Less dependent on Reddit noise
- Less dependent on influencer persuasion

Pep-Talk reduces volatility.

It does not increase it.

---

## SECTION 2: The Audience Reality Constraint

Pep-Talk is not written for academics.

It is not written for reckless experimenters.

It is written for adults trying to solve real problems.

Common entry states:

- “Why am I still hungry on sema?”
- “Why did I lose muscle?”
- “Is this overhyped?”
- “Is this actually different from X?”
- “Why does everyone say this works?”

Many users are tired.

The “9:42pm constraint” applies:
If a tired person lands on a PDP, they must feel oriented within 30 seconds.

If they need to decode jargon before understanding relevance, we failed.

---

## SECTION 3: Voice Identity

Pep-Talk speaks with:

Calm Intelligence  
Controlled Edge  
Practical Realism  

It does not speak with:

Excitement  
Outrage  
Academic Performance  
Moral Superiority  

### Calm Intelligence

- No emotional spikes.
- No dramatic adjectives.
- No hype framing.
- No fear framing.
- Plain language first.
- Depth second.

The voice assumes readers are capable adults.

It never assumes they are experts.
It never assumes they are naive.

### Controlled Edge

Pep-Talk is allowed to say:

- “This is widely repeated but not strongly supported.”
- “Marketing claims exceed the evidence.”
- “This is mostly mechanistic speculation.”
- “This stacks similar appetite suppression mechanisms.”
- “This frequently disappoints for this reason.”

Sharpness is factual.

Sharpness is calm.

Sharpness critiques claims, not people.

Pep-Talk never mocks curiosity.
Pep-Talk never shames experimentation.

### Practical Realism

Pep-Talk acknowledges:

- People experiment.
- People stack.
- People titrate.
- People quit.
- People fail.
- People lose muscle.
- People oversuppress appetite.
- People chase longevity without strong data.

Pep-Talk does not pretend this behavior does not exist.

It organizes reality instead of ignoring it.

---

## SECTION 4: Observational Transparency Doctrine

Pep-Talk includes:

- Clinical dose ranges studied
- Observed titration patterns
- Typical cycle durations reported
- Common stacking patterns
- Common discontinuation reasons
- Side effect clustering patterns
- Cost and access realities

These are framed as:

Documented evidence  
Observed real-world patterns  

Never:

“You should start at”
“You should take”
“Do this protocol”

Clarity reduces harm more effectively than omission.

Omitting real-world patterns to feel “safer” makes the product less useful.

Less useful = less protective.

---

## SECTION 5: Dual-Lane Truth Enforcement

Every peptide and stack is evaluated on two lanes:

Lane 1 – Clinical Evidence  
Lane 2 – Observed Patterns  

They must remain separate.

If clinical data says X and observed patterns say Y:

Pep-Talk states the divergence clearly.

This separation builds trust.

Blending them destroys credibility.

---

## SECTION 6: Emotional Temperature

Pep-Talk runs cool.

Not cold.  
Not dramatic.  
Not excited.  
Not sentimental.  

Cool means:

- Measured
- Direct
- Low adjective density
- Low emotional language
- High clarity
- High signal

---

## SECTION 7: Big Brother Principle (Protective Intelligence)

Pep-Talk has a protective instinct.

Not paternal.
Not authoritarian.

Protective.

It may say:

- “This increases uncertainty.”
- “Stacking these amplifies risk.”
- “This leans heavily experimental.”
- “This commonly leads to nausea or fatigue.”
- “Muscle loss risk is real here.”

The tone is steady, not alarming.

Protection through clarity.

---

## SECTION 8: Anti-Drift Safeguards

If future edits:

- Remove dosing transparency entirely
- Over-legalize language
- Add excessive disclaimers
- Remove real-world stacking discussion
- Eliminate failure patterns
- Remove sharp critique of hype
- Add marketing tone

They violate this charter.

This charter supersedes stylistic preference.

---

## SECTION 9: Content Completion Audit

Before publishing any PDP, Path, Stack output, or update:

Ask:

Does it:
- Inform?
- Empower?
- Steady?

Does it:
- Separate evidence from observation?
- Include practical reality?
- Avoid prescription?
- Avoid hype?
- Avoid moralizing?
- Respect beginners?
- Respect advanced users?

If not, revise.

## SECTION 10: PDP Panel-Specific Rules (non-negotiable)

These rules apply to every peptide detail page panel. They exist because drift happens at the component level, not the system level. Each rule maps to a real failure pattern observed across built panels.

### 10.1 — The Plain Language Opener Rule ("9:42pm Constraint Applied to Panels")

The first sentence of every panel's opening content — headline-text, headline-sub, or "What it is" — must be comprehensible to a tired adult with no biochemistry background.

Violating patterns:
- "A selective GH secretagogue with GHRH-independent ghrelin receptor agonism..."
- "A synthetic heptapeptide derived from ACTH(4-7) with Pro-Gly-Pro sequence for stability..."
- "A GHRH receptor agonist approved for HIV-associated lipodystrophy..."

Passing patterns:
- "The cleanest injectable GH booster in its class..."
- "A cognitive enhancer in nasal spray form — focus, alertness, possible brain protection..."
- "A prescription GH compound with controlled trial evidence for reducing deep abdominal fat..."

The rule: What does it *do* for the person reading this? That goes first. What it is chemically, mechanistically, or regulatorily goes after.

### 10.2 — No FDA-First Framing

FDA approval status is factual and may be included. It must never be the lead.

Prohibited in first position: "FDA-approved...", "Not FDA-approved...", "Investigational drug...", "Approved for HIV-associated lipodystrophy..."

These are useful facts. They belong as the last stat card, or as secondary context after the outcome framing.

If the FDA status is the most interesting thing about a compound, reconsider the framing — there is always a more relevant angle (mechanism, outcome, community interest, honest evidence gap).

### 10.3 — No Disease-Exclusive Fit Gating

The ✓ (tends to benefit) column in the fit matrix must be goals-based, not diagnosis-based.

Prohibited first items:
- "You have HIV-associated lipodystrophy"
- "You have been diagnosed with HSDD"
- "You have chronic hepatitis B or C"

These are true but they gate an optimization-focused audience out of the page in the first line. Reframe:
- "Your goal is reducing visceral fat" (Tesamorelin)
- "You want increased sexual desire and motivation" (Bremelanotide)
- "You're looking for immune resilience support" (Thymosin Alpha-1)

Disease context may appear in the body copy or in a secondary ✓ item, but never as the opening gate.

### 10.4 — No Emojis

Emoji Unicode characters are prohibited in all panel content: 🔬💉🎯💊⚠️🤢❤️💪🧬🔑 and all others.

Acceptable iconography:
- ✓ and ✗ for fit matrix columns
- △ for partial/uncertain signals
- › as a neutral bullet replacement in Safety PLAYBOOK icon fields

The prohibition applies to: STAT_CARDS, FIT_YES, FIT_NO, TIMELINE, COMPARISON, SIGNALS, TRIAL_STATS, MECHANISMS, GAPS, OBSERVED, SIDE_EFFECTS, PLAYBOOK, RED_LINES, INTERACTIONS, and all support pack content.

### 10.5 — Stat Card Ordering

`STAT_CARDS[]` must be ordered by relevance to the user's immediate question, not by regulatory importance.

Order:
1. Mechanism or primary outcome (what it does)
2. Key evidence number (how well it works)
3. Notable tradeoff or secondary characteristic
4. Regulatory/access status (last — important but not the lead)

---

## SECTION 11: Overview Panel Structure Standard (non-negotiable)

Every OverviewPanel.tsx must follow the user-profile structure defined in:

`docs/_governance/pdp_v3_overview_standard.md`

This section exists because every batch of Overview panels built before 2026-02-28 used a stat-card + fit-matrix + comparison-table structure that answered questions no real user asks. It was written for researchers. This is a community product.

### The law in brief:

1. **Opener first** — 1-3 sentences, plain English, outcome-first. What does this do? What's the honest framing of community excitement? No receptor acronyms. No FDA status.

2. **Three user profiles** — Average Person, Athlete, Biohacker (adapted per compound type). Each profile contains: what they think (in their own words), why they're excited (numbered, plain), and a reality check (honest net verdict).

3. **Bottom line** — Two columns: What it is NOT vs. What makes it interesting.

4. **No data arrays** — No STAT_CARDS, FIT_YES, FIT_NO, TIMELINE, COMPARISON. Pure JSX. Human narrative.

### What this replaces:

The old format put receptor names (GPR54/KISS1R) as stat card values. It opened fit matrices with disease diagnoses. It used mechanism-first openers. All of that violates Sections 2, 3, and 10 of this charter and must be rebuilt.

### Reference implementation:

The Kisspeptin Overview panel rewrite (2026-02-28) is the canonical reference for what this looks like in practice.

---

Pep-Talk must remain:

Calm
Structured
Practical
Honest
Human

This is the non-negotiable identity layer.
