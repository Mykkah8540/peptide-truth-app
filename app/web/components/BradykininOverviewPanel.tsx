        Bradykinin is a 9-amino-acid peptide generated from kininogens by the enzyme kallikrein. It acts on
        B1 and B2 receptors to produce vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, pain sensitization,
        and inflammation. Bradykinin plays a central role in the body\u2019s kallikrein\u2013kinin system \u2014
        a cascade that intersects with blood pressure regulation, coagulation, and the inflammatory response.

        Bradykinin is best known clinically as the mediator behind ACE inhibitor\u2013induced angioedema.
        ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) normally degrades bradykinin; when ACE inhibitors block this
        enzyme to lower blood pressure, bradykinin accumulates \u2014 causing tissue swelling that can be
        life-threatening if it involves the airway. This mechanism explains one of the most important drug
        side effects in cardiovascular medicine.

        In hereditary angioedema (HAE), a genetic deficiency of C1-inhibitor leads to uncontrolled plasma
        kallikrein activity and excess bradykinin production. Two targeted therapies address this directly:
        icatibant (Firazyr), a B2 receptor antagonist approved for acute HAE attacks, and lanadelumab
        (Takhzyro), a monoclonal antibody that prevents HAE by inhibiting plasma kallikrein.

        There is no community peptide use of exogenous bradykinin. This page exists as pharmacology
        education \u2014 understanding bradykinin is essential for making sense of ACE inhibitor side effects,
        HAE pathophysiology, pain signaling, and a growing class of targeted therapeutics.
