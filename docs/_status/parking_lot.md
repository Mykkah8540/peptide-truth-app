PDP

This chat marks the first intentional strategic pivot toward a gold-standard editorial PDP architecture.

Important:
This redesign has NOT been architected.
Only CSS scaffolding has been applied.

Structural Redesign (High Priority)

Objective: Replace stacked-card dominance with an editorial hierarchy system.

Current problem:

Excessive pt-card stacking

Uniform border rhythm

Insufficient contrast hierarchy

No structured section weight model

Target direction:

Replace repetitive pt-card stacking with structured editorial sections

Introduce explicit section weight hierarchy:

Primary

Secondary

Utility

Create clear visual contrast between:

Identity

Evidence

Support Layer

Red Flags

Context

Reduce repetitive border rhythm

Introduce breathing room zones

Define contrast zones (not every section boxed)

Introduce layered background depth system

Possibly introduce molecule accent visuals (scientific, restrained, non-gimmick)

Hero Redesign

Retatrutide defines aesthetic gold standard.

Required:

Increase visual gravitas

Improve title scale discipline

Implement editorial spacing system

Define consistent hero layout system

Possibly introduce subtle molecule graphic system

Functional Repair (Required Before UX Enhancements)

The “Things to Consider for Your Situation” module is partially non-functional.

Required:

Fix contextual search filtering logic

Add typeahead suggestions

Add search empty-state guidance

Add active filter indicators

No feature expansion until this works deterministically.

New Components (Concept Only — Not Started)

Protein & Hydration widget

Context-driven support visual module

Section anchor navigation experiment

Sidebar / right-rail experiment

UX Polish (Secondary to Architecture)

Button micro-motion refinement

Scroll behavior polish

Content density rhythm improvements

Clear differentiation between PDP and homepage tone

END PDP PARKING

- Stack community: implement as its own governed system if/when the DB + API contract is expanded (UGC currently supports peptide|blend only).
