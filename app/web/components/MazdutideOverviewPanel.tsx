        Mazdutide (IBI362, OXM3) is a dual GLP-1R/GCGR agonist \u2014 a GLP-1/glucagon co-agonist
        developed by Innovent Biologics and currently in Phase 3 trials in China. Unlike tirzepatide
        (GLP-1/GIP) or retatrutide (GLP-1/GIP/glucagon), mazdutide pairs GLP-1 receptor agonism
        with direct glucagon receptor activation, combining appetite suppression and insulin
        secretion with enhanced hepatic fat oxidation and energy expenditure.

        Phase 2/3 data show approximately 10\u201313% weight loss at 24 weeks and meaningful
        reductions in liver fat \u2014 making it a compelling candidate for obesity and
        NAFLD/MASH. The glucagon component raises energy expenditure in a way that GLP-1 alone
        does not, which is the central rationale for this class.

        Mazdutide is not FDA-approved and has no global regulatory clearance outside China\u2019s
        pathway. The trial dataset is largely China-based, which limits generalizability to Western
        populations. It is not currently available through licensed channels in the United States.

      <p>
        Community context: mazdutide sits in the \u201cpipeline awareness\u201d category \u2014
        people tracking the obesity pharmacology landscape watch it as a signal of where
        GLP-1/glucagon co-agonism is heading, but there is no legitimate route to access it
        outside of clinical trials.
