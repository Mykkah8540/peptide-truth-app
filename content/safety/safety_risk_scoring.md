# How Risk Scores Are Calculated

Risk scores are designed to be conservative and protective, especially when uncertainty is high.

## What the score represents
A 1–10 risk score reflects:
- Potential severity of harm
- Likelihood of harm
- Evidence quality
- Unknowns that matter
- Developmental risk considerations when relevant

## Not a “good vs bad” meter
A low score does not mean a peptide is “recommended.”
A higher score does not mean it is “evil.”
It means the consequence/uncertainty profile is higher.

## Where the math lives
The full scoring logic is defined in:
