        Nesiritide (brand name: Natrecor) is recombinant human B-type natriuretic peptide
        (BNP) \u2014 FDA-approved for intravenous treatment of acute decompensated heart failure
        (ADHF) to reduce dyspnea at rest or with minimal activity. It is a hospital IV medication,
        not a community peptide. It was approved in 2001 based on hemodynamic and symptomatic
        endpoints; its clinical trajectory was substantially altered by the 2011 ASCEND-HF trial.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mechanism: nesiritide activates NPR-A (natriuretic peptide receptor A) \u2014 a guanylyl
        cyclase-linked receptor \u2014 leading to elevated intracellular cGMP. The downstream
        effects are arterial and venous vasodilation (reducing preload and afterload), natriuresis
        (sodium excretion), and modest diuresis. The net hemodynamic effect in ADHF is reduced
        filling pressures and improved cardiac output, which translates to reduced dyspnea.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ASCEND-HF trial (2011, NEJM, 7,141 patients) was the definitive outcome trial. It
        showed a modest reduction in dyspnea at 6 and 24 hours (statistically significant but
        clinically small \u2014 NNT ~14 for 6-hour benefit), no mortality benefit at 30 days, and
        a non-significant trend toward worsening renal function. Post-ASCEND-HF, nesiritide use
        declined significantly as physicians concluded the benefit did not justify the cost and
        renal risk relative to standard ADHF management (IV diuretics, vasodilators).
      </p>
      <p>
        Nesiritide\u2019s place in medicine in 2026 is narrow: it may be used in selected
        patients with ADHF who have inadequate response to standard therapy and no significant
        renal impairment. It is not a community peptide and has no plausible self-administration
        use case \u2014 it requires continuous IV infusion with hemodynamic monitoring.
