        Humanin is a small peptide encoded inside mitochondrial DNA &mdash; one of the first signals discovered that mitochondria send to the rest of the body. Levels decline with age, are lower in people with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and cardiovascular disease, and are higher in exceptionally long-lived people and their children. The animal and cell research is compelling. There are no human clinical trials. The community is acting on a strong mechanistic story that has not yet been tested in humans.

        <blockquote className="reta-overview__profile-think">&ldquo;I have Alzheimer&rsquo;s in my family and I want to do something proactive about brain protection. Is humanin actually relevant for that?&rdquo;</blockquote>

        <ol className="reta-overview__profile-why">
          <li><strong>Humanin was literally discovered by looking for things that protect neurons from Alzheimer&rsquo;s damage</strong><br />It was found in a screen for compounds that prevent neuronal death from amyloid-beta &mdash; the toxic protein associated with Alzheimer&rsquo;s. That&rsquo;s not a vague connection; the neuroprotection story is where humanin research started.</li>
          <li><strong>The centenarian link is the most compelling human signal that exists</strong><br />People who live to 100 and their adult children have measurably higher humanin levels than age-matched peers who didn&rsquo;t inherit longevity genetics. That association is not proof of causation, but it is the kind of human signal that makes the mechanistic story harder to dismiss.</li>
        </ol>
        <p className="reta-overview__profile-check-heading">Reality check</p>
        <p className="reta-overview__profile-check">Cell culture and rodent neuroprotection data does not reliably predict whether a compound will protect human brains from cognitive decline. The history of Alzheimer&rsquo;s drug development is filled with compounds that looked promising in exactly the same type of data and failed in humans. No randomized trial has tested whether taking humanin changes cognition or Alzheimer&rsquo;s risk in people. The honest position is: the story is scientifically coherent and more interesting than most; it has not been validated where it counts. Net: if you have a longevity physician and want to explore this together, that&rsquo;s a reasonable choice to discuss; if you&rsquo;re expecting an Alzheimer&rsquo;s prevention effect, the evidence doesn&rsquo;t support that claim yet.</p>

        <blockquote className="reta-overview__profile-think">&ldquo;If humanin is a signal from mitochondria and improves insulin sensitivity in rodents, does it have any relevance for metabolic performance in athletes?&rdquo;</blockquote>
        <p className="reta-overview__profile-why-heading">Why they&rsquo;re excited</p>
        <ol className="reta-overview__profile-why">
          <li><strong>Mitochondria are central to athletic performance &mdash; a signal from them is interesting</strong><br />Mitochondria produce the energy that powers muscle contraction. A hormone that mitochondria themselves produce as a health signal, and that improves metabolic parameters in animals, is a mechanistically relevant concept for performance-focused users.</li>
          <li><strong>Improved insulin sensitivity in rodent models translates to a concept athletes care about</strong><br />Better insulin sensitivity means better nutrient partitioning &mdash; carbohydrates going to muscle glycogen rather than fat storage. That&rsquo;s a real performance-relevant outcome if the animal data translates.</li>
        </ol>
        <p className="reta-overview__profile-check-heading">Reality check</p>
        <p className="reta-overview__profile-check">Rodent insulin sensitivity data has a poor track record of translating to human metabolic effects &mdash; the graveyard of compounds that worked beautifully in mice and did nothing or caused harm in humans is long. Humanin&rsquo;s human pharmacokinetics after subcutaneous injection are not characterized &mdash; we don&rsquo;t actually know how long it stays active or what concentrations it reaches in muscle tissue. For an athlete looking for a metabolic edge with meaningful human evidence, NMN, creatine, and even basic sleep optimization have substantially better evidence than humanin for mitochondrial and metabolic performance. Net: interesting hypothesis, but not a compound to build a performance protocol around at this evidence stage.</p>

        <blockquote className="reta-overview__profile-think">&ldquo;Humanin is a mitokine &mdash; mitochondria-derived signaling. How does it fit into the broader aging biology picture, and is there a protocol rationale for self-experimentation at this evidence stage?&rdquo;</blockquote>
        <p className="reta-overview__profile-why-heading">Why they&rsquo;re excited</p>
        <ol className="reta-overview__profile-why">
          <li><strong>Mitokines are a genuinely new concept in aging biology with real mechanistic depth</strong><br />The idea that mitochondria communicate their health status to the rest of the body through secreted peptides &mdash; not just through ATP and reactive oxygen species &mdash; is a paradigm shift in how we think about cellular aging. Humanin is the founding member of this class, and MOTS-c (its sibling from the same mitochondrial gene region) extends it. This is frontier biology with legitimate scientific traction.</li>
          <li><strong>Age-declining biomarker with measurable levels &mdash; a rare longevity intervention property</strong><br />Most longevity compounds don&rsquo;t have a measurable endogenous decline that creates a rational basis for supplementation. Humanin does &mdash; you can in principle measure your level and compare it to age norms. That gives the intervention a biomarker anchor that most aging-biology compounds lack.</li>
        </ol>
        <p className="reta-overview__profile-check-heading">Reality check</p>
        <p className="reta-overview__profile-check">The most honest statement is: the mechanistic case for humanin in aging is more coherent than most, but we are still at the &ldquo;promising preclinical&rdquo; stage with no human interventional data. Supplementing it via gray-market research peptides means unknown purity, unknown whether the product is native humanin or the synthetic analog HNG (which is more potent and what most preclinical studies use), and no human pharmacokinetic data to know what dose achieves what tissue concentration. The JAK2/STAT3 pro-survival signaling humanin activates is also the pathway cancer cells use to survive &mdash; active malignancy is a genuine concern, not a theoretical one. Net: if you&rsquo;re building a longevity protocol at this frontier level, humanin is a rational component to discuss with a physician who knows the mitokine literature; self-dosing from gray-market sources without biomarker tracking is acting further out on the evidence curve than most of us should be.</p>
