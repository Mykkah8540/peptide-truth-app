# Topic Page Template v1 (Copy + Layout)

Above the fold:
- Topic title
- 1–2 sentence biology-first definition
- "Who should be extra cautious" (bullets)
- Filter pills: Status, Risk range, Evidence grade, Developmental risk

Main body:
1) What this topic is (and is not)
2) Common misconceptions
3) Peptides people search under this topic (alphabetical list)
   Each item shows:
   - Name
   - Status badge
   - Risk score
   - Developmental badge if applicable
   - 1-line "why it's here" (interest-based, not endorsement)
4) Tradeoffs section (risks must be shown alongside benefits)
5) Evidence notes (why data changes)
6) Links:
   - Risk scoring
   - Evidence grading
   - Adolescents & development

No protocols. No stacks. No sourcing. Neutral, truthful.
