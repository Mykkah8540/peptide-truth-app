Design Spec v2: PDP Editorial Architecture
Status: Draft v1.2 (requires Micah approval before redesign code)
Benchmark PDP: Retatrutide
Doctrine: Stability-first, validator-safe, non-directive education

Purpose
Create a gold-standard editorial PDP system that replaces stacked-card dominance with an Apple-level hierarchy:
- clearer scanning
- fewer boxes
- stronger visual rhythm
- explicit section weight model
- deterministic behavior
- governance-safe posture (no dosing, no protocols, no medical advice)

Non-negotiables
- No schema drift
- Validators must pass before commit
- One scoped change-set per commit
- No feature expansion while core modules are non-deterministic
- UGC must not become canonical content

Phase 1 Explicit Locks
- Single-column only
- Deterministic behavior only
- Mobile-first only
- No right-rail
- No grid system introduced in Phase 1
- No layout wrapper refactors yet
- No moving JSX between components until Hero spec locked
- Retatrutide PDP is the only implementation target initially
- All changes must preserve existing deterministic rendering
- No API changes
- No content contract changes

Editorial Narrative Order (Locked Spine)
A PDP must answer, in order:
1) What is this?
2) How strong is the evidence?
3) Why do people care?
4) What are the risks?
5) Where does this fit contextually?
6) What tools help interpretation?

This order is architectural, not visual.

I. Primary Layer (Authority + Intellectual Posture)
Primary sections are open.
No .pt-card.
These sections rely on spacing + typography — not boxes.

1. Hero (Identity Anchor)
- Canonical name
- Status category
- Taxonomy context
- Evidence posture signal (summary only)
- Framing line (1–2 sentence orientation)

No decorative clutter.
No right-rail.
Watermark allowed only as low-contrast texture token (default OFF).

2. Overview (Core Explanation)
- What it is
- Mechanism summary
- Why it exists in conversation

Large vertical breathing.
No border box.
No heavy accents.

3. Evidence Posture (Signal Only)
- Approved / Investigational / Preclinical
- Research maturity
- Confidence signal

Signal summary only.
No citation overload.
No expandable lists here.

Primary ends here.
Primary must feel light, controlled, authoritative.

II. Secondary Layer (Depth Without Dominance)
Secondary sections use soft container styling.
.pt-card remains — but reduced contrast and reduced border dominance.

4. Why People Discuss It
- Trends
- Use cases
- Cultural context
- Hype vs signal

5. Safety & Red Flags
- Structured
- Clear
- Visually differentiated
- Not alarmist

Red flag accent allowed here only.

6. Interactions
- Stack awareness
- Overlap risks
- Synergy claims (non-directive)

7. Evidence Detail (Expandable)
- Citation lists
- Expandable blocks
- Collapsible on mobile if long

Prevents citation overload above the fold.

III. Utility Layer (Interpretive Tools)
Utility is visually subordinate.
Subtle background zone or very light container.
Never competes with Safety.

8. “Things to Consider for Your Situation”
Must be:
- Deterministic
- Fully functional
- Graceful degradation
- Clear empty states

Functional repair required before UX enhancement.

9. Protein & Hydration Widget
Concept only.
Not Phase 1.
No layout allocation yet.

10. Anchor Navigation
Utility-only experiment.
Not structural in Phase 1.
No sticky behavior defined yet.

Section Weight Model (Locked)
Primary:
- Open
- No box
- Generous spacing

Secondary:
- Soft container
- Reduced border contrast
- Consistent rhythm

Utility:
- Muted background or subtle container
- Reduced contrast

Card Elimination Strategy (Phase 1)
Remove .pt-card from:
- Hero
- Overview
- Evidence Posture

Retain .pt-card (softened) for:
- Secondary
- Utility

No new wrapper elements introduced yet.

Contrast Zones (Token-Based, Not Structural)
Zone A — Open White (Primary)
Zone B — Soft Elevated (Secondary)
Zone C — Muted Background (Utility)

Implemented through tokens only.
No structural wrapper refactors yet.

Allowances (Explicit)
Subtle molecule watermark in hero:
- Allowed only as an optional design token, OFF by default
- Must be non-illustrative, ultra-low contrast, never competes with title/CTA
- If it distracts, remove it

Icons in section titles:
- Allowed only for Utility sections
- Inline SVG only (no deps)
- Primary/Secondary rely on typography + spacing, not icons

Right-rail:
- Banned in Phase 1

Retatrutide accents:
- Neutral system-wide tokens only (no Retatrutide-only styling)
