        GHRP-2 is an injectable compound that stimulates your body to release more growth hormone. It works — but it also raises cortisol and prolactin, two hormones most people are not trying to elevate. A cleaner alternative called ipamorelin was developed specifically to get the GH benefit without those tradeoffs.

        <ol className="reta-overview__profile-why">
          <li><strong>It actually makes your body produce more GH</strong><br />GHRP-2 was one of the first compounds shown to meaningfully boost GH output without injecting GH itself. That proof of concept is real &mdash; it does what the name says.</li>
          <li><strong>It&rsquo;s been around long enough to feel established</strong><br />GHRP-2 has decades of research behind it. For someone just learning about GH compounds, that history can make it feel like a known quantity with credibility.</li>
        </ol>
        <p className="reta-overview__profile-check-heading">Reality check</p>
        <p className="reta-overview__profile-check">GHRP-2 raises cortisol alongside GH &mdash; and cortisol is a stress hormone that breaks down muscle and disrupts sleep, which runs directly counter to why most people want more GH in the first place. The community largely moved on from GHRP-2 to ipamorelin, which produces similar GH release without the cortisol burden. If you&rsquo;re starting fresh, ipamorelin is the more sensible first step. Net: interesting history, but not the best starting point today.</p>

        <blockquote className="reta-overview__profile-think">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m already on ipamorelin. I read that GHRP-2 produces a stronger GH pulse &mdash; is it worth switching for better results?&rdquo;</blockquote>
        <p className="reta-overview__profile-why-heading">Why they&rsquo;re excited</p>
        <ol className="reta-overview__profile-why">
          <li><strong>Higher peak GH output than ipamorelin</strong><br />GHRP-2 does produce a larger acute GH spike at comparable doses. For athletes who want maximum GH signal per injection, that potency difference is real.</li>
          <li><strong>Research legacy gives it credibility</strong><br />GHRP-2 was studied extensively in human clinical trials. The pharmacology is well-documented compared to some newer compounds, and athletes researching the mechanism can find real data.</li>
        </ol>
        <p className="reta-overview__profile-check-heading">Reality check</p>
        <p className="reta-overview__profile-check">More GH with more cortisol is not a better deal for recovery or body recomposition. Cortisol is catabolic &mdash; it directly counteracts the anabolic signal you&rsquo;re trying to generate. The athletes who tried GHRP-2 for these goals and then switched to ipamorelin generally report that the net results were worse despite the higher GH spike. Greater potency that comes bundled with a catabolic counter-signal is not an upgrade. Net: the switch is not warranted for recovery or body recomp goals.</p>

        <blockquote className="reta-overview__profile-think">&ldquo;I want to understand where GHRP-2 sits in the GHRP family mechanistically. Is there any scenario where it&rsquo;s the right choice over ipamorelin?&rdquo;</blockquote>
        <p className="reta-overview__profile-why-heading">Why they&rsquo;re excited</p>
        <ol className="reta-overview__profile-why">
          <li><strong>The original proof-of-concept compound for ghrelin receptor agonism</strong><br />GHRP-2 established that synthetic compounds could reliably drive GH release through the ghrelin receptor. Understanding it is foundational for understanding how ipamorelin was designed as a selective improvement &mdash; the selectivity story makes no sense without knowing what GHRP-2 did wrong.</li>
          <li><strong>Highest acute GH pulse of the earlier GHRPs</strong><br />In contexts where short-cycle maximum GH output is the explicit goal and cortisol elevation is considered acceptable or manageable, GHRP-2 occupies a specific niche. Some protocols combine it with ghrelin-receptor-selective compounds specifically for this pulse amplitude.</li>
        </ol>
        <p className="reta-overview__profile-check-heading">Reality check</p>
        <p className="reta-overview__profile-check">The cortisol and prolactin co-elevation is not trivial even from a systems perspective. Sustained cortisol elevation suppresses immune function, degrades sleep architecture, and can affect HPA axis calibration over time. The prolactin elevation adds another variable that most protocols are not measuring. For most biohacker-level protocols, ipamorelin plus CJC-1295 provides superior sustained GH output with a cleaner hormonal profile. GHRP-2 has a narrow legitimate use case: understanding the GHRP family history and short-cycle maximum-pulse applications where the cortisol tradeoff is explicitly accepted. Net: mechanistically interesting, narrowly useful, generally outclassed.</p>
