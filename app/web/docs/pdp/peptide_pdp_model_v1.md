# Pep-Talk Peptide PDP Model (v1)

## Purpose
This document defines the canonical, non-negotiable structure, tone, and intent
for all peptide detail pages (PDPs) in the Pep-Talk application.

This model prioritizes clarity, realism, and education without encouragement
or discouragement of use.

---

## Core Principle
This page exists to help a curious or already-exposed person understand:
- what this peptide is
- why people talk about it
- what it may do
- what to watch for
- where uncertainty still exists

## Tone Rules (Non-Negotiable)

- Assume user intelligence
- Assume curiosity
- Assume some users are already using
- Educate holistically
- No scare language
- No moralizing
- No metadata leakage (population/confidence enums)
- No “curation pending” on live pages

## Section Definitions

### Plain-English Overview
2–4 sentences. No disclaimers. No metadata. No warnings.

### Why People Are Interested
Reflect real-world curiosity without endorsement.

### Practical Considerations
Explain how nutrition and activity interact with outcomes when relevant.
No macros, dosing, or plans.

### Practical Risks
Start with lived, common downsides before scientific or regulatory risks.

### Uncertainty Statement (Template)
While this peptide shows meaningful promise, much of what is known today comes
from animal studies and limited human trials. Ongoing research will determine
how these findings translate into approved clinical use.

---

## Stability Rule
This model must remain valid before and after FDA approval.
Only the regulatory section should materially change over time.
