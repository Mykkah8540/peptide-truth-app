# Roadmap
This file is authoritative for execution order.
It is not a brainstorm. Parking lot ideas do not belong here.

Rule
Only one active task may exist at a time.
The active task must be recorded in docs/_status/next_task.md.

Phase 0 Foundation
- Repo hydration and execution contracts are in place
- Deterministic validation exists
- One-command session workflow exists

Phase 1 PDP Rebuild
- Peptide PDP layout conforms to docs/ui/Master_UI_and_Content_Polish.md
- PDP Contextual Considerations tool is implemented per docs/ui/PDP_Contextual_Considerations.md
- Community comments section is implemented per blueprint
- PDP rebuild checklist is used and conformance report stays green

Phase 2 Navigation and IA
- Navbar and mobile nav conform to routes and nav contract
- Pillars are reachable cleanly on mobile and desktop
- No drift in route naming

Phase 3 Accounts and Billing
- Account surfaces are polished and correct
- Subscription state and upgrade flows are correct
- No fake portals or broken entitlement handling

Phase 4 Stacks System
- Explore Stacks is two-lane (curated, approved community)
- Submission flow exists with approval gate
- No hype sorting, no rankings, no endorsement framing

Phase 5 Wellness Paths
- System-first educational framing
- Cross-linking to peptides, resources, stacks when relevant
- Remains valid if peptides become regulated or removed

Phase 6 Resources Backbone
- Science literacy engine pages exist
- Evidence and uncertainty are taught clearly
- No action framing or vendor framing

Phase 7 Polish and Hardening
- Mobile and desktop audits complete
- Accessibility and performance baseline
