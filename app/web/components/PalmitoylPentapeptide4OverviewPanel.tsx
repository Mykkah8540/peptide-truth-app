        Palmitoyl pentapeptide-4 (sold as Matrixyl) is a cosmetic signal peptide designed to
        stimulate pro-collagen synthesis in skin fibroblasts. It is a topical cosmetic
        ingredient\u2014not a pharmaceutical, not an injectable, and not a systemic treatment.

          The peptide sequence (Lys-Thr-Thr-Lys-Ser, or KTTKS) mimics a collagen-derived
          fragment that signals fibroblasts to produce more collagen I, III, and fibronectin.
          The palmitoyl fatty acid tail is attached to improve penetration through the lipid
          barrier of the stratum corneum.
        </p>
        <p>
          In vitro cell culture studies\u2014many of them industry-funded\u2014consistently show
          that palmitoyl pentapeptide-4 stimulates collagen synthesis. The honest question is
          whether enough intact peptide reaches live fibroblasts in the dermis when applied
          topically to intact human skin. That question does not yet have a strong independent
          answer.
        </p>
        <p>
          What the evidence does support: small controlled trials and photographic studies
          show modest improvements in skin appearance and self-reported firmness. Whether
          that benefit is driven by collagen remodeling, hydration from the formulation, or
          placebo is difficult to separate without independent, blinded RCT data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tolerance is excellent. Palmitoyl pentapeptide-4 has one of the lowest toxicity
          profiles of any cosmetic active\u2014contact sensitization is rare. It is appropriate
          for most skin types and is commonly combined with retinoids, AHAs, and other signal
          peptides (most notably palmitoyl tripeptide-1 in the Matrixyl 3000 combination).
        </p>
        <p>
          Injectable use is not established, not studied, and has no rational basis given
          that this compound was designed and optimized for topical delivery. There is no
          safety or dosing data for any other route.
