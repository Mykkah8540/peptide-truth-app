# Hormones, Puberty, and Endocrine Axes

## Why this matters
Endocrine systems regulate growth, development, metabolism, mood, fertility, and recovery.
Many peptides intersect with these pathways directly or indirectly.

## The major axes
- HPG axis (gonadal): puberty progression, fertility signaling
- HPT axis (thyroid): metabolic rate, energy, temperature regulation
- GH/IGF signaling: growth and tissue remodeling signals
- Insulin/glucose systems: appetite, fat storage, energy utilization
- Stress systems (HPA): cortisol dynamics, resilience, sleep effects

## What can go wrong (general risks)
- Rebound effects after stopping exposure
- Appetite/metabolic adaptation
- Mood or sleep disturbance
- Downstream hormonal imbalance signals

## How the app handles endocrine risk
- Claims must be evidence-linked or labeled hypothesis/unknown
- Adolescents get special caution when the peptide plausibly affects endocrine calibration
- Risk score incorporates uncertainty penalties
