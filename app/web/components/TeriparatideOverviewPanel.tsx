        Teriparatide (brand name Forteo) is FDA-approved recombinant human PTH(1\u201334) \u2014 the active
        fragment of parathyroid hormone \u2014 used to treat severe osteoporosis. It is the only anabolic
        bone agent in widespread clinical use that genuinely builds new bone rather than just slowing
        bone loss. It is administered as a once-daily subcutaneous injection, typically for up to
        two years.

        The mechanism is counterintuitive at first glance. Sustained elevation of parathyroid hormone
        (as occurs in primary hyperparathyroidism) actually causes bone loss. But intermittent PTH
        pulses \u2014 mimicking the transient spike produced by a once-daily injection \u2014 have the
        opposite effect: they stimulate osteoblast activity and new bone formation, increasing bone
        mineral density in the spine and hip. This is the pharmacological insight teriparatide
        exploits. The distinction between continuous and pulsatile PTH is one of the more elegant
        examples of dose-timing driving pharmacological direction in modern medicine.

        The clinical evidence base is substantial. The landmark NEJM 2001 randomized controlled
        trial by Neer et al. demonstrated a 65% reduction in vertebral fracture risk and approximately
        53% reduction in non-vertebral fracture risk compared to placebo in postmenopausal women with
        severe osteoporosis. These figures remain among the strongest fracture-reduction data for any
        osteoporosis therapy. Teriparatide is also approved for men with osteoporosis and for
        glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis \u2014 indications where the evidence is solid though
        somewhat less granular than the postmenopausal data.

        There is a critical sequencing requirement that distinguishes teriparatide from antiresorptive
        drugs (bisphosphonates, denosumab): when you stop teriparatide, bone turnover shifts sharply
        back toward resorption, and the bone gained during treatment is rapidly lost without a
        follow-on antiresorptive agent. This is not a side effect \u2014 it is the expected biology.
        Every clinical guideline requires transition to a bisphosphonate or denosumab after completing
        the teriparatide course. Patients who stop teriparatide without a follow-on agent essentially
        waste the treatment.

        The two-year lifetime cumulative limit (which, for purposes of this limit, is counted together
        with abaloparatide \u2014 the other PTH-related anabolic agent) reflects the osteosarcoma black
        box warning derived from high-dose, lifetime-exposure rat studies. The human risk translation
        remains debated, and post-marketing surveillance in millions of patient-years has not
        established a clear excess osteosarcoma signal in humans. Nevertheless, the regulatory limit
        stands and is observed in clinical practice. Teriparatide is generally reserved for patients
        with the highest fracture risk: multiple prior fractures, very low T-scores, failure of
        antiresorptive therapy, or glucocorticoid-induced severe disease.

        From a practical standpoint, common side effects are transient and manageable: orthostatic
        hypotension (particularly in the first few doses), nausea, leg cramps, and mild hypercalcemia
        are the ones patients most often notice. Monitoring serum calcium and urinary calcium is
        standard during treatment. Teriparatide is one of the more logistically demanding
        osteoporosis treatments \u2014 daily injections for up to two years, refrigerated storage,
        close monitoring \u2014 but for the right patient, it offers a level of bone rebuilding that no
        antiresorptive agent can match.
