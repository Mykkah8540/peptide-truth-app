        Motilin is a 22-amino acid peptide secreted by enterochromaffin cells in the upper
        small intestine. Its primary function is to trigger the migrating motor complex (MMC)
        \u2014 the cyclical \u201chousekeeping\u201d contractions that sweep the small intestine
        clean between meals, moving undigested material toward the colon. It acts on motilin
        receptors (MLNR), a GPCR expressed in GI smooth muscle and neurons.

        Motilin\u2019s clinical relevance comes primarily through its agonists rather than the
        peptide itself. Erythromycin \u2014 the antibiotic \u2014 is a potent MLNR agonist at
        sub-antimicrobial doses and has been used for decades as a prokinetic agent for
        gastroparesis and postoperative ileus. Synthetic motilin agonists (camicinal, GSK962040,
        and others) were developed specifically for GI motility disorders, but clinical trial
        results have been disappointing \u2014 most failed to show durable efficacy in
        gastroparesis.

        Motilin is related to ghrelin \u2014 both structurally and functionally. The motilin
        receptor (MLNR) and the ghrelin receptor (GHSR1a) belong to the same receptor
        superfamily, and ghrelin itself has motilin-like prokinetic effects on the GI tract.
        This relationship has driven research interest in ghrelin agonists for gastroparesis.

        There is no therapeutic formulation of exogenous motilin. No pharmaceutical company
        markets a motilin peptide product. This peptide exists in \u201cresearch peptide\u201d
        channels without any evidence base for its use as an exogenous agent \u2014 its
        physiological role is endogenous hormonal signaling, not pharmacological supplementation.
