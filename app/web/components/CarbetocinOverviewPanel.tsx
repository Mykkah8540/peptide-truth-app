        Carbetocin is a synthetic, long-acting analogue of oxytocin used as a uterotonic agent to prevent
        postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) \u2014 the leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide. Structural
        modifications to the oxytocin backbone give carbetocin a half-life of approximately 40 minutes,
        compared to roughly 3 minutes for natural oxytocin, enabling effective single-dose prevention
        rather than the prolonged infusions oxytocin typically requires.

        Carbetocin acts on uterine oxytocin receptors to produce sustained uterine contractions,
        preventing uterine atony (failure of the uterus to contract after delivery), which is the
        most common cause of PPH. It is listed as a WHO essential medicine and is widely used
        internationally, particularly following cesarean delivery.

        The landmark CHAMPION trial (Lancet, 2018) \u2014 a 23-country, 29,645-patient RCT \u2014
        demonstrated non-inferiority of carbetocin to oxytocin for PPH prevention after cesarean
        delivery, with a comparable safety profile. Carbetocin is not FDA-approved in the United States
        (oxytocin remains the standard of care there) but holds regulatory approval across most of
        Europe, Canada, and many middle-income countries.

        There is no community peptide use of carbetocin outside its obstetric indication. Unlike
        intranasal oxytocin, which is sometimes discussed in wellness and social bonding contexts,
        carbetocin has no off-label community application and is not available on gray markets.
        This page covers carbetocin as pharmacology context for the broader oxytocin-class peptides.
