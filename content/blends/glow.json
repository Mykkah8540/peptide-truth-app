BPC-157 drives angiogenesis \u2014 the formation of new blood vessels that supply the injury site. TB-500 mobilizes cells into that vascularized area to rebuild the extracellular matrix. GHK-Cu provides the collagen synthesis signal and anti-inflammatory support that sustains the process. The combination is designed for broader regenerative coverage than any single compound provides, which is why it's a popular choice for soft tissue recovery and skin health."
