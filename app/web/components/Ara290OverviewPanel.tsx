        ARA-290 is an 11-amino acid synthetic peptide derived from the tissue-protective domain of
        erythropoietin (EPO). It targets the innate repair receptor (IRR) &mdash; not the
        classical EPO receptor &mdash; producing anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects
        without any red blood cell production. It is a research compound with small clinical
        trials in neuropathic conditions, not an approved drug.
      </p>

      <h3>The two faces of EPO</h3>
      <p>
        Erythropoietin has two distinct receptor systems with different tissue distributions and
        functional outcomes. The classical hematopoietic receptor (EpoR homodimer) drives red blood
        cell production in bone marrow &mdash; the target of EPO doping and anemia therapy. The
        tissue-protective receptor &mdash; also called the innate repair receptor (IRR) &mdash; is a
        heterodimer of EpoR and the beta-common receptor (CD131). IRR is expressed broadly in
        non-hematopoietic tissues: peripheral nerve, brain, retina, kidney, heart. Its activation
        promotes cellular survival, reduces apoptosis, and dampens inflammatory signaling.
      </p>

      <h3>ARA-290 design rationale</h3>
      <p>
        ARA-290 was engineered to bind the IRR selectively while having no affinity for the EpoR
        homodimer. The sequence (HTVLALY + surrounding residues) corresponds to the B-helix of EPO
        that contacts CD131. By selectively engaging only the tissue-protective receptor,
        ARA-290 aims to capture EPO&apos;s neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects without
        erythropoietic stimulation, thrombosis risk, or the hematocrit elevation associated with
        full-length EPO.
      </p>

      <h3>Clinical research areas</h3>
      <p>
        Published clinical research has focused primarily on two areas: sarcoidosis-associated
        small fiber neuropathy (SFN) and diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Small randomized trials
        have shown improvements in neuropathic pain scores, quality of life, and &mdash; in the
        sarcoidosis SFN study &mdash; an increase in intraepidermal nerve fiber density (a direct
        structural measure of nerve repair). These results are intriguing but require confirmation
        in larger trials. ARA-290 is not FDA-approved and is not commercially available as a
        pharmaceutical.
      </p>

      <h3>Current status</h3>
      <p>
        ARA-290 remains a research compound. Community sources are unverified research-grade
        products without pharmaceutical manufacturing standards. The compound lacks an approved
        safety profile, established dosing guidelines, or regulatory oversight for human use outside
        of clinical trials. Interest in the peptide community centers on its purported
        neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties, which are biologically plausible but
        inadequately characterized for off-label use.
