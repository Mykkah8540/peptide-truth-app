# Interactions: Drugs, Supplements, and Peptides

## What an interaction is (here)
An interaction is a credible reason that combining exposures could:
- Increase risk
- Reduce predictable effects
- Create harder-to-detect harm

## Interaction types you’ll see
- Additive physiology (same pathway pushed twice)
- Opposing physiology (masking signals or compensation)
- Metabolic load (organ stress, electrolyte shifts, blood pressure changes)
- Neurochemical overlap (sleep/mood/cognition effects)

## The standard in this app
- No stacking guides
- No protocols
- Interactions are described as risk concepts with evidence and uncertainty clearly labeled

If a combination is widely discussed online but lacks evidence, it will be labeled accordingly.
