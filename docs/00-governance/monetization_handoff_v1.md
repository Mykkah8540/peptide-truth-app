# Pep-Talk Future Build & Monetization Handoff (v1)

This document defines where Pep-Talk is going, how it becomes a business, and which paths are explicitly allowed vs forbidden.

The system has already been architected correctly for monetization without compromising trust. The goal is leverage, not feature bloat.

## 1) Core Monetization Philosophy (Non-Negotiable)

Pep-Talk does not monetize by:
- selling fear
- gating basic education
- hiding safety information
- acting like a clinic, prescriber, or protocol service
- turning into a supplement shop or reseller

Pep-Talk monetizes by being:
- the most trusted reference layer in a messy market
- the decision-clarifying layer between hype and action
- the context engine people return to repeatedly

Trust is the asset. Monetization is downstream.

## 2) The Funnel (How users naturally move)

### Phase 1 — Discovery (already live / working)
Entry points:
- Google search (SEO pages: peptides, topics, interactions)
- Social / community links
- Word of mouth (“look it up on Pep-Talk”)

User intent:
- “What is this?”
- “Is this real or hype?”
- “What do people actually experience?”

Do not monetize here. This is where credibility is earned.

### Phase 2 — Orientation (current PDP work)
The PDP teaches:
- what it is
- why people care
- what it appears to do
- practical considerations
- practical risks
- where uncertainty exists

Soft signals only:
- Save this peptide
- Compare
- Build a stack
- Track what you’re researching

Still no hard monetization.

### Phase 3 — Personalization (primary monetization pivot)
Allowed features:
- Account system
- Saved peptides
- Saved stacks
- Research history
- Goal tagging (fat loss, recovery, cognition, etc.)
- Personal notes

Free tier:
- No saves
- No stacks
- No longitudinal tools

Paid tier ($9–$19/mo):
- Unlimited saves
- Stack builder
- Cross-peptide interaction awareness
- Long-term research tracking
- Change alerts (new evidence, risk updates)

Monetization is organization + clarity, not knowledge withholding.

## 3) Stack Builder = Flagship Paid Feature

Stack builder is not:
- a protocol generator
- a dosing engine
- a prescription tool

It is:
- a conceptual compatibility explorer
- a risk-awareness engine
- a goal-based reasoning tool

It shows:
- mechanism overlap
- redundant pathways
- interaction warnings
- practical risks stacking
- nutritional / training considerations at a systems level

Why people pay:
- prevents bad decisions
- saves time
- reduces risk
- feels professional

## 4) Professional / Enterprise Paths (High-leverage)

Verticals:
- Clinics (education layer for patients)
- Coaches / trainers (reference tool)
- Physical therapists
- Researchers
- Content creators (fact checking)

Offerings:
- White-labeled reference portals
- API access to peptide metadata
- Evidence change feeds
- Risk taxonomy licensing

B2B monetization, not consumer exploitation.

## 5) What we will NEVER do (Locked)

Pep-Talk must never:
- sell peptides
- link to vendors
- accept affiliate money
- recommend doses
- generate protocols
- act as a medical authority

## 6) Why the current architecture matters

The work already done enables monetization because:
- content is structured, not free-text
- risks are classified
- evidence is indexed
- interactions are modeled
- PDPs are stable pre- and post-approval
- tone is neutral and durable

Paid features sit around content; content never needs to change to monetize.

## 7) Near-term Roadmap (6–12 months)

Priority order:
1. Finish PDP UX polish (consistency, rhythm)
2. Finalize stack builder (logic first, UI second)
3. Add accounts + saves
4. Launch paid tier quietly
5. Observe behavior
6. Expand peptide coverage
7. Expand interaction registry
8. Add professional tier

## 8) Future work filter

Any future engineering or product work should ask:
- Does this increase trust?
- Does this increase clarity?
- Does this reduce risk?
- Does this create leverage later?

If “no” to all four, it’s probably noise.
