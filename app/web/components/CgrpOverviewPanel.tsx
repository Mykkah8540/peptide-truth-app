        Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a 37-amino-acid neuropeptide produced by alternative
        splicing of the calcitonin gene. It is one of the most potent vasodilators known in human
        physiology and serves as a key signaling molecule in the trigeminal pain pathway. CGRP is
        released from the peripheral and central terminals of trigeminal nerve fibers during migraine
        attacks, where it drives vasodilation, neurogenic inflammation, and central sensitization.
      </p>
      <p>
        The CGRP receptor is a heterodimer of calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) and receptor
        activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1). This receptor complex became one of the most
        pharmacologically validated drug targets of the past decade \u2014 triggering a wave of
        FDA-approved therapies that transformed migraine treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two drug classes now target the CGRP pathway. CGRP monoclonal antibodies \u2014 erenumab
        (Aimovig), fremanezumab (Ajovy), galcanezumab (Emgality), and eptinezumab (Vyepti) \u2014
        are used for migraine prevention, administered monthly or quarterly. Gepants \u2014
        rimegepant (Nurtec), ubrogepant (Ubrelvy), and atogepant (Qulipta) \u2014 are small-molecule
        CGRP receptor antagonists used for acute migraine treatment and, in the case of atogepant and
        rimegepant, also for prevention. Together these drugs represent the first migraine-specific
        preventive therapies ever developed.

        There is no community injection use of exogenous CGRP. CGRP appears in this database because
        understanding its biology is essential for making sense of the fastest-growing drug class in
        neurology. If you or someone you know uses any CGRP-targeted therapy, this page will help
        you understand the mechanism, evidence, and relevant considerations.
