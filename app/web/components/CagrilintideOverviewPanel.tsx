        Cagrilintide is an investigational weekly injection being developed by Novo Nordisk as a complement to semaglutide, not as a standalone weight loss drug. Alone it produces roughly 10% weight loss &mdash; similar to older GLP-1 medications. Combined with semaglutide in a formulation called CagriSema, Phase 2 data showed around 25% body weight reduction, which is competitive with the best currently approved options. It works through a completely different mechanism than GLP-1 drugs, which is exactly why the combination is pharmacologically interesting. It is not FDA-approved and not available outside clinical trials in pharmaceutical grade.

        <blockquote className="reta-overview__profile-think">&ldquo;I keep hearing about new weight loss drugs. Cagrilintide keeps coming up alongside semaglutide. What is it and when might it be available?&rdquo;</blockquote>

        <ol className="reta-overview__profile-why">
          <li><strong>The combination data is genuinely impressive</strong><br />Semaglutide alone produces roughly 15% weight loss. Tirzepatide produces around 22%. CagriSema Phase 2 data showed approximately 25% &mdash; which would place it at or above the best currently approved option. If that holds in Phase 3, it represents meaningful progress for people who haven&rsquo;t achieved their goals on current drugs.</li>
          <li><strong>It&rsquo;s still a once-weekly injection</strong><br />For people familiar with GLP-1 injections, the format is the same &mdash; a once-weekly subcutaneous shot. Adding cagrilintide to semaglutide in the CagriSema combination doesn&rsquo;t change the administration burden. It&rsquo;s still one weekly pen, not an additional injection regimen on top of what you&rsquo;re already doing.</li>
        </ol>
        <p className="reta-overview__profile-check-heading">Reality check</p>
        <p className="reta-overview__profile-check">Phase 2 results are encouraging but Phase 3 is where drugs succeed or fail. The history of obesity pharmacology includes drugs that looked excellent in Phase 2 and didn&rsquo;t replicate, or revealed safety signals only visible in larger, longer trials. CagriSema Phase 3 (the REDEFINE trials) is ongoing. The drug does not exist in approved form and cannot be safely replicated by sourcing both compounds separately from gray-market suppliers &mdash; the titration schedules and combined formulation in the trial are specifically designed to manage tolerability. Net: worth watching, but Phase 3 data doesn&rsquo;t exist yet and &ldquo;Phase 2 promising&rdquo; is not the same as &ldquo;approved and available.&rdquo;</p>

        <blockquote className="reta-overview__profile-think">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve used semaglutide for a cut cycle. Is cagrilintide something that adds meaningfully to fat loss, or is the 25% result mostly because you&rsquo;re just getting more GLP-1 effect?&rdquo;</blockquote>
        <p className="reta-overview__profile-why-heading">Why they&rsquo;re excited</p>
        <ol className="reta-overview__profile-why">
          <li><strong>The mechanism is genuinely additive, not redundant</strong><br />Semaglutide works through the GLP-1 receptor. Cagrilintide works through a completely different receptor system &mdash; the amylin receptor &mdash; which signals satiety through the brainstem&rsquo;s area postrema, suppresses glucagon independently of GLP-1, and slows gastric emptying through a distinct pathway. Combining them doesn&rsquo;t just pile on more GLP-1 effect; it hits appetite and glucose regulation through two different biological handles simultaneously.</li>
          <li><strong>Amylin effects on glucagon suppression are relevant for body composition</strong><br />Glucagon promotes fat oxidation but also opposes insulin action and raises blood glucose. Suppressing glucagon while managing insulin dynamics through the amylin mechanism has body composition implications that go beyond simply eating less. For athletes thinking about the metabolic environment during a cut, the glucagon suppression angle is meaningful beyond just appetite reduction.</li>
        </ol>
        <p className="reta-overview__profile-check-heading">Reality check</p>
        <p className="reta-overview__profile-check">The 25% weight loss in Phase 2 was measured under clinical trial conditions with structured titration, controlled dosing, and medical monitoring &mdash; not community self-administration alongside training. Muscle loss with aggressive caloric restriction is a real concern with any GLP-1 era drug, and there is no Phase 2 data on body composition (fat vs. muscle) specifically for CagriSema yet. Gray-market cagrilintide combines an unvalidated source with a compound whose dose-response in athletic populations has never been studied. The GI side effects during titration (nausea, reduced appetite) are significant enough that training performance is typically degraded early in the course. Net: mechanistically interesting and worth following, but using gray-market material before Phase 3 data exists is running well ahead of the evidence.</p>

        <blockquote className="reta-overview__profile-think">&ldquo;I want to understand the amylin receptor pharmacology &mdash; the calcitonin receptor plus RAMP complex &mdash; and figure out where cagrilintide sits in the stack alongside existing GLP-1 therapy. What does the receptor crosstalk look like?&rdquo;</blockquote>
        <p className="reta-overview__profile-why-heading">Why they&rsquo;re excited</p>
        <ol className="reta-overview__profile-why">
          <li><strong>The receptor biology creates genuinely distinct satiety signaling</strong><br />The amylin receptor is a heterodimer of the calcitonin receptor paired with RAMP1 or RAMP3 proteins. This is a different receptor family entirely from the GLP-1 receptor. Area postrema signaling through this receptor produces satiety signals that are mechanistically independent of the GLP-1 pathway &mdash; meaning the combination targets both the central satiety circuits differently and the peripheral glucagon/gastric emptying mechanisms through non-overlapping pathways. This is genuinely complementary pharmacology, not just dose stacking.</li>
          <li><strong>Pramlintide&rsquo;s 2-4 kg weight effect tells you something important about the monotherapy ceiling</strong><br />The only approved amylin analog &mdash; pramlintide, which requires multiple daily injections &mdash; produces modest weight loss (2-4 kg) in diabetic populations. Cagrilintide&rsquo;s 10% monotherapy result is substantially higher, suggesting the long-acting weekly format meaningfully improves on pramlintide&rsquo;s amylin area coverage. The gap between pramlintide and cagrilintide monotherapy is itself mechanistically interesting from a pharmacokinetic standpoint.</li>
        </ol>
        <p className="reta-overview__profile-check-heading">Reality check</p>
        <p className="reta-overview__profile-check">The same calcitonin receptor that cagrilintide activates for satiety is also present in thyroid C-cells &mdash; the same concern that exists for GLP-1/GIP agonists. The thyroid C-cell tumor concern in the class applies to amylin receptor agonists through the calcitonin receptor. This is not a theoretical risk unique to one drug &mdash; it&rsquo;s a class-level concern with the receptor family. Gray-market CagriSema simulation by combining two separate research peptides bypasses the titration pharmacology the clinical trials used to manage tolerability &mdash; the REDEFINE protocol specifically sequences dose escalation of both compounds together, and the tolerability data reflects that managed titration. Self-combining at full doses without that framework isn&rsquo;t the same experiment. Net: excellent mechanistic rationale, Phase 3 data still pending, and the gray-market combination approach gets you a different pharmacological experiment than what the trials are actually running.</p>
