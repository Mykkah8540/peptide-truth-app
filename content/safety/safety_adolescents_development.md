# Adolescents & Development

This app cannot stop peptide use. It can help people understand tradeoffs and consequences.

## The core reality
Adolescents are not small adults. During puberty and late adolescence, the body is actively setting long-term regulatory patterns (“setpoints”) across:
- Hormones and growth signaling
- Brain development, reward systems, and mood regulation
- Metabolism and appetite regulation
- Sleep architecture and recovery patterns

A short-term result can carry long-term cost if it pushes a developing system off-course.

## Why risk can be different for teens
Many peptides influence systems that are still calibrating:
- Growth hormone / IGF signaling
- Thyroid signaling
- Gonadal axis (testosterone/estrogen regulation)
- Insulin sensitivity and appetite regulation
- Neurotransmitter systems related to mood and reward

Even when short-term side effects appear minimal, long-term data for teens is often absent.

## What “developmental risk” means in this app
A peptide may be flagged for developmental risk if:
- It plausibly affects endocrine or neurodevelopmental signaling
- There is meaningful uncertainty about adolescent safety
- Potential consequences may be long-lived or difficult to reverse

This is not moral judgment. It is a protective flag.

## If you are under 18 (or a parent/coach)
Start with:
- Status badge (Approved vs Investigational vs Preclinical)
- Risk score and rationale
- Evidence snapshot (human vs animal vs mechanistic)
If the data is thin, treat uncertainty as part of the risk.
