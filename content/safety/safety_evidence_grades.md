# How Evidence Works Here

This app distinguishes evidence types so users don’t confuse “interesting” with “proven.”

## Evidence grades (simplified)
- Regulatory label: official approved product labeling
- RCT meta-analysis / RCT: strongest general human evidence
- Human interventional: controlled but not necessarily large or definitive
- Human observational: signals, associations, more confounding
- Animal / in-vitro: useful, not guaranteed to translate
- Mechanistic-only: plausible theory, not established benefit or safety

## Confidence labels
- High: replicated strong human evidence or label/guideline support
- Moderate: human evidence exists but limited or mixed
- Low: weak or indirect evidence
- Hypothesis: plausible but not confirmed in humans
- Unknown: insufficient data

## A key rule
If evidence is thin, uncertainty is part of the risk.
