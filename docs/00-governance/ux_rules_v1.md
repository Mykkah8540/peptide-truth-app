# UX Rules v1 (Authoritative)

Non-negotiables for the Peptide Truth App UX.

## 1) Library Organization
- The library is a SINGLE unified index sorted alphabetically by canonical_name.
- Categories are LABELS, not separate sections.
- Users can filter by: status, risk score range, developmental risk, route (descriptive), evidence grade.

Rationale:
Users search by name. Splitting by category causes misses and confusion.

## 2) Above-the-Fold PDP Order (Most Important First)
1) Name + aliases
2) Status badge (very clear)
3) Risk score (1–10) + one-paragraph rationale
4) “Who should be extra cautious” (population flags)
5) Evidence snapshot (human vs preclinical)

## 3) Badges (Always Visible)
- Status:
  - Approved for human use
  - Investigational / Not approved
  - Preclinical (animal/in-vitro)
  - Theoretical / unmanufactured
- Developmental Risk:
  - If triggered, show a distinct warning badge
- Evidence Grade:
  - Highest grade present for key claims (not cherry-picked)

## 4) Dosing / Exposure Presentation Rule
- The app does NOT provide protocols or instructions.
- It may display "observed exposure ranges in studies" descriptively, with citations, and a “not instructions” banner.

## 5) Neutrality + Truth Standard
- Not endorsing or condemning.
- When evidence is strong, say so.
- When evidence is weak/absent, say so.
- Never hide uncertainty.

## 6) UX Guardrails Against Misuse
- No sourcing guidance, no administration how-to, no reconstitution, no cycling protocols.
- Adolescents: emphasize irreversibility, long-term setpoints, and lack of data when true.
