# PDP Layout Spec v1 (Authoritative)

Goal
A Peptide Detail Page (PDP) must be trust-building, safety-forward, and exhaustive without being overwhelming.

## 1) Above-the-Fold (Non-negotiable Order)
1) Canonical name + aliases
2) Status badge + "last reviewed" date
3) Risk score (1–10) + plain-English rationale (always visible, not collapsed)
4) "Who should be extra cautious" (population flags; developmental risk shown here if true)
5) Evidence snapshot
   - Human evidence present? (yes/no)
   - Best available evidence grade (label/rct/etc)
   - Largest unknown(s) in 1 line

## 2) Core Sections (In this order)
A) Overview (what it is / what it is not)
B) Status & Availability (regulatory + real-world note)
C) Mechanism of Action
   - Known vs hypothesis clearly labeled
D) Human Evidence
   - Benefits / neutral / adverse together (no benefit-only section)
E) Preclinical Evidence
   - Animal and in-vitro separated
F) Hypothesized Effects (explicitly labeled)
G) Time Dynamics (onset/duration/persistence; tolerance signals)
H) Risks & Adverse Effects (short-term vs serious vs unknowns)
I) Contraindications & Pre-existing Conditions
J) Interactions (drug / supplement / peptide)
K) Observed Exposure Ranges in Studies
   - Descriptive only
   - Always includes a “not instructions” banner
L) Developmental / Adolescent Risk Block (only if triggered)
M) Evidence Ledger (all sources)
N) Changelog (versioning)

## 3) Visual Language Rules
- Badges must be plain and factual (no green “good” vs red “bad” tone)
- Developmental warning must be distinct and always visible when true
- Evidence grade must be visible anywhere a strong claim is made

## 4) Copy Rules (Tone)
- Neutral: "is associated with", "has been observed", "has not been established"
- Avoid hype
- Avoid moralizing
- Explicitly separate human vs animal vs mechanistic

## 5) Guardrails
- No procedural instructions.
- No sourcing guidance.
- No "how to stack" sections.
- If users request protocols, route to methodology + descriptive study exposure and risk context.
