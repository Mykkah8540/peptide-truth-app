# Pep-Talk / Peptide-Truth App — Build Notes

## Mission (Non-Negotiable)
Pep-Talk exists to be the most trustworthy, educational, public-facing
source of truth for peptides and bioactive compounds.

Education stays free.
Tools, personalization, and advanced utilities are premium.

## Monetization Strategy (High Level)

### Free (Always)
- Peptide lookup (PDPs)
- Risk scores, tiers, evidence grades
- Educational content
- Safety pages

- Clean, ad-light UX

### Pro (Paid)
- Stack Builder (create, save, compare)
- Blend deep dives
- Saved stacks & favorites
- User profiles

## Advertising & Sponsors

- Mobile-first priority
- Appears on:
  - Home
  - PDPs
  - Blends

## Homepage Intent

Homepage should:
- Feel welcoming and credible

- Promote Pro without pressure
- Contain editable regions (no redeploy required)

Planned sections:

## User Accounts (Planned, Not Yet Built)

Future user capabilities:

- Pro-only features tied to account

Auth + billing intentionally deferred until UX + value are locked.

- Trust > monetization
- No dark patterns
- No medical advice
- Clear separation between:

  - Tools
  - Advertising
