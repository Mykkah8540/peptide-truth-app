# PDP v3 Standard — Site-Wide Design
Status: **Active Standard** (as of 2026-02-27)
Applies to: All peptide PDPs (Retatrutide is the built benchmark; all others to be migrated)
Supersedes: `pdp_hero_v2_spec.md`, `pdp_layout_v1.md`, `design_spec_v2_pdp_editorial_architecture.md` (all archived to `_vault/`)

## North Star

The PDP is the trust engine. It must feel calm, intentional, layered, human.

It must answer in the first 10 seconds:
1. What is this?
2. Will it actually do what I'm hoping for?
3. What do I need to know to be safe?
4. What's still unknown?

It must not feel like a medical journal, a vendor page, or a safety spectacle.

## Hero Composition

### Layout (desktop: 3-column grid; mobile ≤999px: single column)
- **Col 1 (~190px):** VialImage (slug-specific PNG, falls back to `_generic.svg`)
- **Col 2 (1fr):** H1 canonical title + frame sentence + quick-jump nav + "For your situation" CTA
- **Col 3 (~320px):** Single frosted glass card (Status chip / Context chip / Evidence grade / Disclaimer)
- **Row 2 (spans cols 1–2):** "For your situation" pill button → `#considerations`

### Mobile hero addendum
- Small inline vial image (`<slug>-sm.png`, 70×105px portrait) appears left of H1 in title row
- Columns collapse to single stack; "For your situation" button becomes full-width

### Hero content rules
- H1: Playfair Display 900, ~clamp(44px, 5vw, 62px), `--reta-navy`
- Frame sentence: calm single-sentence orientation ("What it is, why people care, what to watch for…")
- No risk scores, no letter grades, no numeric scoring anywhere
- Evidence grade: use `evidenceGradeLabel()` from `lib/riskIndex` — one plain-language sentence

## Tab System

### Tab IDs and labels
| id | label | content |
|---|---|---|
| `overview` | Overview | Decision tool: stats, fit matrix, timeline, comparison |
| `evidence` | Evidence | 3-lane: signals, trial data, mechanism, gaps, observed |
| `safety` | Safety | Side effect grid, mitigation playbook, red lines |
| `interactions` | Interactions | Searchable 37-entry map with category filters |
| `considerations` | For You | Ghost typeahead contextual search + support layer |
| `community` | Community | Scroll anchor (content: null) → scrolls to community section |

### Tab behavior
- Client component (`PDPTabs.tsx`) with `useState` for active tab
- `history.replaceState` updates URL hash on click (no page reload, no scroll jump)
- `hashchange` listener: activates correct tab from URL hash (hero jump links work)
- Inactive panels: `display: none` via `.reta-tabs__panel--hidden` (in DOM for SEO)
- Community tab: `content: null` → triggers `scrollIntoView` instead of panel swap

### Sticky behavior
- `.reta-tabs__sticky-unit`: `position: sticky; top: 70px (desktop) / 60px (mobile); z-index: 40`
- Bar is NOT itself sticky — the wrapper is (avoids overflow clipping issues)
- Swipe hint: mobile-only tab tongue below bar, `border-radius: 0 0 14px 14px`, `background: rgba(15,26,46,0.10)`

## Design Language

### Color tokens
```css
--reta-navy:    #0f1a2e   /* headings, body text, active tab */
--reta-body-bg: #dce4ee   /* page background gradient base */
```

### Frosted glass cards (`.reta-g-card`)
```css
background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.74);
backdrop-filter: blur(24px) saturate(1.6);
border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.52);
border-radius: 20px;
box-shadow: [3-layer shadow + inset highlight];
padding: 24px 28px;
```

### Tab bar (`.reta-tabs__bar`)
```css
background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.88);
border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08);
border-radius: 14px;
padding: 5px;
```

### Active tab button (`.reta-tabs__btn--active`)
```css
background: var(--reta-navy);
color: #ffffff;
box-shadow: 0 1px 4px rgba(15, 26, 46, 0.30);
```

### Signal tier system (used across Evidence, Safety, Interactions)
- `flag` → red/amber badge — stop and assess
- `watch` → amber badge — monitor
- `low` → green badge — minimal concern

### Page background (`.pt-benchmark`)
```css
background: var(--reta-body-bg) with dual radial gradients (cool blue/gray tones)
```

## Panel Content Requirements

### Overview tab
Answers: "Will this work for me? How much vs alternatives?"
- **Stat cards:** 2–4 headline numbers (e.g., "~24% body weight lost", "~17% vs placebo")
- **Fit matrix:** ✓ column (who tends to benefit) + ✗ column (who tends to struggle), 4–6 per side
- **Timeline:** 3 phases (weeks 1–4, months 1–3, month 3+) with plain-language expectations
- **Comparison table:** Reta vs 2 alternatives, 4–5 metrics, active peptide column highlighted

### Evidence tab
Answers: "What does the science actually say — and what's still missing?"
- **Signal tiles:** 6 tiles, each with `tier: "strong" | "moderate" | "none"`, 1 sentence each
- **Trial stats:** 4 headline numbers from the key study, with citation
- **Mechanism breakdown:** 3 cards (known proven / reinforcement / new/uncertain)
- **Gaps:** 6 bullets of honest "what we don't know yet"
- **Observed block:** 5 bullets of real-world patterns, clearly labeled "Observed — not clinical evidence"

### Safety tab
Answers: "How do I be safe on this? What do I watch for?"
- **Side effect grid:** 6 items with `tier: "low" | "watch" | "flag"`, incidence and note
- **Mitigation playbook:** 5 cards (protein, hydration, GI management, training, sleep), each with specific actions
- **Red lines:** 6 stop-now signals with actions — "call/go to ER, don't wait"
- **Risk proportion closer:** Calm framing of the realistic vs dramatic risks

### Interactions tab
Answers: "What does this interact with? How do I mitigate risk?"
- **37+ entries** organized as `Interaction[]` with `{ id, name, aliases[], category, tier, summary, mitigation[] }`
- **5 categories:** medications, stimulants, supplements, recreational, peptides
- **Live search:** filters across name, aliases, summary
- **Category chips:** show counts, highlight active filter

### Considerations tab
Answers: "What applies specifically to my situation?"
- **Ghost typeahead search:** inline suggestion, Tab to complete, Enter to commit
- **43+ consideration packs** each with: `title, tags[], summary, body[], cautions[], callToAction`
- **Support layer** (if present): rendered after search results via `SupportLayerSection`

## Tone Rules (from Constitution — non-negotiable)

- **Informed, Empowered, Steadied** — the three emotional outcomes every page delivers
- **Big Brother principle:** protective intelligence, not paternal authority — "doctor friend" voice
- **Dual-Lane Truth:** clinical evidence and observed patterns always explicitly separated
- **No prescriptive language:** never "you should", "start at", "take X"
- **Observational transparency IS allowed:** study dose ranges, titration schedules, common patterns — always framed as descriptive, not instructive
- **No numeric risk scores, no letter grades, no spectacle framing**

---

## Non-Negotiable Technical Rules

- No schema drift (validators must pass before every commit)
- Build must be green before push
- One scoped change-set per commit
- No multi-file mutation scripts
- No blind JSX deletion
- Non-reta PDPs: untouched until migration is deliberately planned per playbook

## What Is Still `isRetatrutide`-Gated (to be generalized)

The following in `page.tsx` are currently gated to Retatrutide only:
- `reta-hero-v2` hero composition
- `BodyClass className="reta-page"` (page background)
- `reta-body-tabs` wrapper + Start Here strip
- `PDPTabs` with dedicated panel components
- `reta-community` class on community wrapper

**Generalization path:** See `pdp_scaling_playbook.md`.
