        Melanotan-I (MT-I) is a synthetic analogue of alpha-MSH (\u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating
        hormone) that acts primarily on the MC1R receptor to drive melanin synthesis \u2014
        producing skin darkening without UV exposure. Its pharmaceutical form, afamelanotide,
        was FDA-approved as Scenesse for erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP), a rare genetic
        disorder causing severe photosensitivity. The \u201cmelanotan-I\u201d available through
        research peptide channels is the same molecule but not pharmaceutical-grade.
      </p>
      <p>
        MT-I is more receptor-selective than melanotan-II. Where MT-II hits MC1R, MC3R, MC4R,
        and MC5R (producing tanning, sexual arousal, and appetite effects), MT-I\u2019s primary
        target is MC1R \u2014 the receptor directly responsible for melanin production. This
        selectivity means fewer sexual side effects and cardiovascular signals than MT-II, but
        it does not make MT-I safe for unmonitored cosmetic use.
      </p>
      <p>
        The FDA-approved afamelanotide program (Clinuvel Pharmaceuticals) requires a Risk
        Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) with dermatology surveillance because MC1R
        agonism in individuals with dysplastic nevi, high nevus count, or MC1R risk alleles
        may accelerate melanocyte activity in ways that require monitoring. The community
        tanning context strips out all of that risk management.
      </p>
      <p>
        Community use involves subcutaneous injection for cosmetic tanning. The
        evidence for tanning efficacy is real \u2014 the evidence for safety in the general
        cosmetic population without dermatology monitoring does not exist.
