# Sources Folder

This folder is for shared evidence metadata and optionally PDFs/exports.

- _sources_index.json:
  Global deduplicated registry of evidence items (source_type + source_id).
- Peptide JSON files may also embed evidence items locally; later we can normalize into this registry.
- No copyrighted PDFs should be distributed unless licensed; store links and metadata first.
