# Parking lot

- Mobile menu: hamburger dropdown for global nav (mobile-first)
- Home page: define final layout, content, and purpose (what it should look like + why)
- Pharmacology interface: drug–peptide interaction/conflict surface (if evidence exists), with severity + evidence tier + disclaimers

## Parking Lot
- **Stack Builder**: page exists but is placeholder; implement real goal-based builder + saved stacks + sharing.
- **Topics**: ensure each topic/category is fully populated + consistent (categories hub -> topic pages -> peptide groups -> links).
- **Home page**: define final mobile-first layout + what lives on Home vs Topics hub.
- **Pharmacology interface**: add medication/contraindication/interaction explorer (drug class conflicts where evidence exists).
- **Mobile navigation**: iterate on global nav UX polish (icons, active state, accessibility, keyboard nav).
