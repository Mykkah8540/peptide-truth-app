        Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), also called B-type natriuretic peptide, is a 32-amino-acid cardiac
        peptide secreted primarily by ventricular myocytes in response to volume overload and increased wall
        stress. Despite its name, BNP is made in the heart \u2014 the \u201cbrain\u201d label is a historical
        artifact from its discovery in porcine brain tissue. It is one of the most clinically important
        peptide biomarkers in medicine.

        BNP and its inactive cleavage fragment NT-proBNP are the gold-standard blood tests for diagnosing
        and monitoring heart failure. When the ventricles are under pressure \u2014 from fluid overload,
        poor contractility, or high afterload \u2014 BNP levels rise proportionally. Elevated BNP in a
        patient with shortness of breath strongly suggests cardiac rather than pulmonary cause, and
        levels track treatment response.

        Physiologically, BNP acts as the heart\u2019s built-in pressure-relief valve: it causes natriuresis
        (sodium and water excretion), vasodilation, and inhibition of the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013
        aldosterone system (RAAS) and sympathetic nervous system. These effects counteract the
        neurohormonal activation that worsens heart failure.

        Nesiritide (Natrecor) is recombinant human BNP, FDA-approved for acute decompensated heart failure
        (ADHF). It produces rapid symptom relief through vasodilation and diuresis. However, the large
        ASCEND-HF trial showed no mortality benefit and raised concern about worsening renal function,
        significantly narrowing its use in practice. Nesiritide is now reserved for specific situations
        in ADHF management.
      </p>

        There is no community peptide use of BNP or nesiritide. This page covers BNP as both a diagnostic
        biomarker and a pharmacological agent, providing context for patients and clinicians navigating
        heart failure management.
